the year ahead let begin with what were go to do to help work peopl in our countri get ahead and stay ahead now I dont think presid obama and vice presid biden get the credit they deserv for save us from the worst econom crisi of our lifetim our economi is so much stronger than when they took offic nearli 15 million new privat sector job 20 million more american with health insur and an auto industri that just had it best year ever now that real progress but none of us can be satisfi with the statu quo not by a long shot were still face deepseat problem that develop long befor the recess and have stay with us through the recoveri ive gone around the countri talk to work famili and ive heard from mani who feel like the economi sure isnt work for them some of you are frustrat even furiou and you know what your right it not yet work the way it should american are will to work and work hard but right now an aw lot of peopl feel there is less and less respect for the work they do and less respect for them period democrat we are the parti of work peopl but we havent done a good enough job show we get what your go through and were go to do someth to help So tonight I want to tell you how we will empow american to live better live My primari mission as presid will be to creat more opportun and more good job with rise wage right here in the unit state from my first day in offic to my last especi in place that for too long have been left out and left behind from our inner citi to our small town from indian countri to coal countri from commun ravag by addict to region hollow out by plant closur and here what I believ I believ america thrive when the middl class thrive I believ our economi isnt work the way it should becaus our democraci isnt work the way it should that whi we need to appoint suprem court justic who will get money out of polit and expand vote right not restrict them and if necessari we will pass a constitut amend to overturn citizen unit I believ american corpor that have gotten so much from our countri should be just as patriot in return mani of them are but too mani arent it wrong to take tax break with one hand and give out pink slip with the other and I believ wall street can never ever be allow to wreck main street again and I believ in scienc I believ climat chang is real and that we can save our planet while creat million of goodpay cleanenergi job I believ that when we have million of hardwork immigr contribut to our economi it would be selfdef and inhuman to tri to kick them out comprehens immigr reform will grow our economi and keep famili togeth and it the right thing to do So whatev parti you belong to or if you belong to no parti at all if you share these belief thi is your campaign If you believ that compani should share profit not pad execut bonus join us If you believ the minimum wage should be a live wage and no one work full time should have to rais their children in poverti join us If you believ that

innov small busi and infrastructur If we invest in infrastructur now well not onli creat job today but lay the foundat for the job of the futur and we will also transform the way we prepar our young peopl for those job berni sander and I will work togeth to make colleg tuition free for the middl class and debt free for all We will also liber million of peopl who alreadi have student debt it just not right that donald trump can ignor hi debt and student and famili cant refin their debt and someth we dont say often enough sure colleg is crucial but a fouryear degre should not be the onli path to a good job We will help more peopl learn a skill or practic a trade and make a good live do it We will give small busi like my dad a boost make it easier to get credit way too mani dream die in the park lot of bank In america if you can dream it you should be abl to build it and we will help you balanc famili and work and you know what If fight for afford child care and paid famili leav is play the woman card then deal me in now here the other thing now were not onli go to make all of these invest were go to pay for everi singl one of them and here how wall street corpor and the super rich are go to start pay their fair share of tax thi is not becaus we resent success but when more than 90 percent of the gain have gone to the top 1 percent that where the money is and we are go to follow the money and if compani take tax break and then ship job oversea well make them pay us back and well put that money to work where it belong creat job here at home now I imagin that some of you are sit at home think well that all sound pretti good but how are you go to get it done how are you go to break through the gridlock in washington well look at my record ive work across the aisl to pass law and treati and to launch new program that help million of peopl and if you give me the chanc that exactli what ill do as presid but then I also imagin peopl are think out there but trump he a businessman he must know someth about the economi well let take a closer look shall we In atlant citi 60 mile from here you will find contractor and small busi who lost everyth becaus donald trump refus to pay hi bill now rememb what the presid said last night dont boo vote but think of thi peopl who did the work and need the money not becaus he couldnt pay them but becaus he wouldnt pay them He just stif them and you know that sale pitch he make to be presid put your faith in him and youll win big that the same sale pitch he made to all those small busi then trump walk away and left work peopl hold the bag He also talk a big game about put america first well pleas explain what part of america first lead him to make trump tie in china not colorado trump suit in mexico not michigan trump furnitur in turkey not ohio trump pictur frame in india not wisconsin donald trump say he want to make america great again well he could start by actual make thing in america again now the choic we face in thi elect is just as stark when it come to our nation secur you know anyon  anyon  read the news can see the threat and turbul we face from baghdad to kabul to nice and pari and brussel from san bernardino to orlando were deal with determin enemi that must be defeat So it no wonder that peopl are anxiou and look for reassur look for steadi leadership want a leader who understand we are stronger when we work with our alli around the world and care for our veteran here at home keep our nation safe and honor the peopl who do that work will be my highest prioriti Im proud that weve put a lid on iran nuclear program without fire a singl shot now we have to enforc it and we must keep support israel secur Im proud that we shape a global climat agreement now we have to hold everi countri account to their commit includ ourselv and Im proud to stand by our alli in nato against ani threat they face includ from russia ive laid out my strategi for defeat isi We will strike their sanctuari from the air and support local forc take them out on the ground We will surg our intellig so we detect and prevent attack befor they happen We will disrupt their effort onlin to reach and radic young peopl in our countri It wont be easi or quick but make no mistak we will prevail now donald trump donald trump say and thi is a quot I know more about isi than the gener do No donald you dont He think he know more than our militari becaus he claim our arm forc are a disast well ive had the privileg to work close with our troop and our veteran for mani year includ as a senat on the arm servic committe and I know how wrong he is our militari is a nation treasur We entrust our command in chief to make the hardest decis our nation face decis about war and peac life and death A presid should respect the men and women who risk their live to serv our countri includ captain khan and the son of tim kain and mike penc both marin So just ask yourself do you realli think donald trump ha the tempera to be command in chief donald trump cant even handl the rough and tumbl of a presidenti campaign He lose hi cool at the slightest provoc when he gotten a tough question from a report when he challeng in a debat when he see a protest at a ralli imagin if you dare imagin imagin him in the oval offic face a real crisi A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapon I cant put it ani better than jacki kennedi did after the cuban missil crisi she said that what worri presid kennedi dure that veri danger time wa that a war might be start not by big men with selfcontrol and restraint but by littl men the one move by fear and pride america strength doesnt come from lash out It reli on smart judgment cool resolv and the precis and strateg applic of power and that the kind of command in chief I pledg to be and if were seriou about keep our countri safe we also cant afford to have a presid who in the pocket of the gun lobbi Im not here to repeal the second amend Im not here to take away your gun I just dont want you to be shot by someon who shouldnt have a gun in the first place We will work tirelessli with respons gun owner to pass common sens reform and keep gun out of the hand of crimin terrorist and all other who would do us harm you know for decad peopl have said thi issu wa too hard to solv and the polit too hot to touch but I ask you how can we just stand by and do noth you heard you saw famili member of peopl kill by gun violenc on thi stage you heard you saw famili member of polic offic kill in the line of duti becaus they were outgun by crimin I refus to believ we cant find common ground here We have to heal the divid in our countri not just on gun but on race immigr and more and that start with listen listen to each other tri as best we can to walk in each other shoe So let put ourselv in the shoe of young black and latino men and women who face the effect of system racism and are made to feel like their live are dispos let put ourselv in the shoe of polic offic kiss their kid and spous goodby everi day head off to do a danger and necessari job We will reform our crimin justic system from end to end and rebuild trust between law enforc and the commun they serv and we will defend all our right civil right human right and vote right women right and worker right lgbt right and the right of peopl with disabl and we will stand up against mean and divis rhetor wherev it come from you know for the past year mani peopl made the mistak of laugh off donald trump comment excus him as an entertain just put on a show they thought he couldnt possibl mean all the horribl thing he say like when he call women pig or said that an american judg couldnt be fair becaus of hi mexican heritag or when he mock and mimic a report with a disabl or insult prison of war like john mccain a hero and a patriot who deserv our respect now at first at first I admit I couldnt he meant it either It wa just too hard to fathom that someon who want to lead our nation could say those thing could be like that but here the sad truth there is no other donald trump thi is it and in the end it come down to what donald trump doesnt get america is great becaus america is good So enough with the bigotri and the bombast donald trump not offer real chang he offer empti promis and what are we offer A bold agenda to improv the live of peopl across our countri to keep you safe to get you good job to get your kid the opportun they deserv the choic is clear my friend everi gener of american ha come togeth to make our countri

elect in our democraci is import in it own way but I cant think of an elect that is more import certainli in my lifetim and it not so much that I am on the ticket It is becaus of the stark choic that is pose to america in thi elect So when I did  when I did wake up thi morn  thank you when I  when I  when I did  did start move and bill and I start drink our coffe or ask that it be administ through an IV   we suddenli look at each other and we realiz as of tomorrow we have 100 day to make our case to america So what better place to kick off thi campaign than right here in philadelphia where it

four great day of our convent you heard someth veri differ from the republican didnt you We  we might as well have been talk about two differ countri or as someon said to me two differ planet donald trump paint a pictur a neg dark divis pictur of a countri in declin He insist that america is weak and he told us all after lay out thi veri dark pictur that I alon can fix it now as I  as I watch and heard that it set off alarm bell becaus just think about what happen here 240 year ago think about our founder come togeth a declar of independ write a constitut they set up our form of govern the longestlast democraci in the histori of the world and you know they did it they did it  they did it becaus they knew they didnt want one person one man to have all the power like a king and think about georg washington our first presid after he serv he step down voluntarili peopl around him couldnt believ it but he said no thi is the exampl we should set A democraci requir someth from all of us not just peopl we elect but everi singl one of us and washington set that exampl and I dont know ani founder no matter how  how strong they were how smart they were who believ that onli they could solv our problem So and ill tell you someth els ill tell  ill tell you someth els they also expect a kind of raucou debat in america but at the end of the debat we have to come togeth and get thing done dont we So as tim said we are go to get on a bu as soon as we leav here and were go to drive through pennsylvania and into ohio it kind of nostalg for me My dad wa born in scranton I spent everi summer of my life up in northeast pennsylvania My father my brother went to penn state so I know I  I know how beauti thi commonwealth is and how wonder the peopl are but weve got work to do Im not satisfi with the statu quo Im not tell you that everyth is just peachi keen Im tell you weve made progress but we have work to do if were go to make sure everybodi is includ and  and you know I think that weve got to have more good job weve got to rais wage weve got to tackl inequ weve got to make thi economi work for everyon not just those at the top and  and if you listen realli close to the republican convent you know that donald trump talk for 75 minut and did not offer one solut In fact hi  hi speech hi whole convent seem more about insult me instead of help the american peopl So here what ive said I will do and were go to get to work on the veri first day within the first 100 day of our administr were go to break through the gridlock in washington and make the biggest invest in new goodpay job sinc world war II were go to do it in infrastructur technolog clean energi advanc manufactur and Im also go to pay special attent to those part of our countri that have been left out

to find a job to get ahead and stay ahead that my goal So on our bu tour were go to be visit a few place where peopl are make thing I find it highli amus that donald trump talk about make america great again He doesnt make a thing in america except bankruptci So there a lot to be done my friend and Im excit Im excit to have tim and ann as part of thi team and Im excit to have the 42nd presid of the unit state as part of thi team the four of us are go to barnstorm the countri becaus as a veri smart presid who just so happen to be here today onc said there is noth wrong with america that cant be cure by what right with america So now we had a great convent but weve got to go out and weve got to fight for our vision of the futur and I cant do it alon I need each and everi one of you

the road from here 240 year ago now nobodi who look like me wa thought to be possibl to run for presid back then No one who look like barack obama wa thought to be possibl but contrari to donald trump I believ everi time we knock down a barrier in america it liber everyon in america I have to say last night after  after the end of our convent I knew  I knew that everi parent in thi countri could look at their son or their daughter and now say the veri same thing you too could be presid of the unit state thank you all god bless you and after the convent wa over start friday morn tim kain and hi wonder wife ann and bill I and I got on a bu and start travel across pennsylvania into ohio We visit factori small town bigger citi We met with so mani hardwork peopl who told us their stori and they prove everi day that donald trump is wrong america is not weak I agre with warren thi is the greatest nation on earth and our best day are still ahead of us now that doesnt mean we dont have challeng and problem Of cours we do right here at home and around the world 182000 but I dont believ there is anyth that american cant do if we make up our mind becaus you know whi We are stronger togeth but as warren said too mani peopl havent gotten a rais sinc the great crash there too much inequ and too littl opportun washington is paralyz by special interest and big money but dont let anyon tell you we dont have what it take if we make up our mind to solv our problem and dont believ anyon who tell you I alon can fix it when donald trump said that in hi convent speech I did a bit of a mental doubletak I listen to that speech 75 minut of it and it wa like he wa talk about a differ countri forget about everyon in america who get up everi day and work togeth peopl who make a differ everi singl day he forget our troop on the front line he forget polic offic and firefight who run toward danger he forget about doctor and nurs who save live and teacher who chang live he forget about union who fight for work famili and commun that pull togeth through hard time I grew up in the midwest I wa born in chicago rais outsid of chicago My dad wa a small businessman I mean realli small It wa mostli just him and occasion my mother my brother and me and sometim he would hire helper to get one of hi order out becaus he print fabric to be made into draperi and he had a print plant with long tabl He wa a veri selfreli man but I dont think he for a minut through hi grow up in scranton pennsylvania through hi servic as a chief petti offic in the navi through hi work and busi or hi rais our famili ever thought to himself I alon can fix it that just not the way we were rais We were rais to get togeth We were rais to follow up on the extraordinari exampl of our founder 240 year ago in philadelphia who came togeth you see that across nebraska you see peopl work I have been in omaha I have visit project school other kind of nonprofit and institut where peopl are work togeth that what we do in america We see a problem and we say we will fix it togeth and that what were go to do when we get the white hous to move us forward in the direct we need to go now I know how hard the great recess wa It wa a terribl time the worst financi crisi sinc the great depress and peopl in nebraska work hard to come back I think it wa a terribl moment It could have gotten even wors I believ that a lot of difficult decis had to be made and we have come back from that terribl financi crisi thank to the hard work of nebraskan american and presid obama we got out of the ditch we were in So I think if were go to solv the problem we have we ought to be realli clear about where we have come from We now have 15 million new job that have been creat in the last sevenandahalf year We now have 20 million more american who have access to health care 182515 We have the highest percentag ever in our histori of young peopl walk across graduat stage to get their high school diploma So I know we have made progress but I know we shouldnt be satisfi As american we alway have to be ask ourselv what can we do better how can we make more progress how can we help more peopl were still face tough challeng that develop long befor the recess and they have stay with us the economi is not work the way it should for everyon start in iowa back in april of 2015 until the convent thi week I have met so mani peopl who tell me you know they dont expect a handout they dont even expect you know life to be easi but they dont think it should be thi hard It shouldnt be that peopl feel like theyr out there on their own like no one care about them that theyr not respect that the digniti of their job is not someth that we all support I know a lot of peopl who feel that way I bet there are some in thi gymnasium who feel that way well here what I want you to know you deserv a presid who will get up everi singl day in the white hous and do everyth she can to give you the chanc you deserv to have and I will quickli add as import as it is to have someon who get what your go through I think it also realli import that that person tell you what her plan are for produc result So if you saw what I

mission as presid will be to do everyth I can to help our countri creat more job with rise incom I believ anyon will to work hard should be abl to find a job that pay well enough to support a famili So in my first 100 day we are go to break through the gridlock in washington and make the biggest invest in new goodpay job sinc world war II We are go to make the boldest invest in american infrastructur sinc the highway system warren read you some of the quot from donald trump well he ha said so mani thing that I profoundli vehement disagre with and for the life of me I dont know whi someon run to be presid of the unit state who think and say we never win anymor our countri is full of loser well he could not be more wrong We are go to fix and build the road the bridg the tunnel the port the airport the water system we need and I want to say a particular word to ani of you here from rural nebraska We are go to bring divers econom develop to rural commun to support our farmer and other in small town who keep america go and one specif way we will do that is to make sure we have an electr grid that can take and distribut energi from clean renew sourc  In fact I know becaus ive seen them in the crowd there are few peopl from iowa here today and your neighbor iowa is alreadi get onethird of it electr from clean energi primarili wind energi and what I love about them is theyr also give farmer extra incom for host the turbin on their farm and they are take abandon factori and actual assembl the wind turbin put peopl to work in iowa to produc the energi for iowa the other thing were go to do is finish the job of build out broadband so everybodi in america no matter where you live ha access to the internet good morn I am so pleas to be here I want to thank you all for the invit for the introduct to everyon associ with nabj and nahj I want to just mark the moment becaus you were creat in thi hotel I dont know if there are ani origin founder but if there are could you all stand up and we could give you some recognit I am delight to thank you for the import work you do everyday and now more then ever we need you to keep hold leader and candid account and in the tradit of pathbreak journalist like ethel payn and ruben salazar we need you to make sure that america front page and nightli new cast and onlin inform reflect the great divers of our nation someon that I had the privileg of know the late great bob maynard former owner of the oakland tribun onc said and I quot bob It is in see ourselv whole that we can begin to see way of work out our differ of understand our similar and becom a more cohes nation and that is what you do everyday help us to see ourselv as whole  Im look forward to our discuss which Im sure will cover a wide rang of issu but I want to take just a few minut to focu on a challeng that doesnt get enough attent on the campaign trial although ive been tri and that is how do we expand econom opportun for africanamerican and latino across america and you know veri well  it been said  that when the economi catch a cold commun of color get pneumonia the great recess hit our whole countri hard but the toll wa especi difficult for black and latino famili black wealth wa cut in half for latino it drop 66 percent that repres decad even gener of hard work and dure these past 18 month peopl across our countri have describ to me how hard it been to get back on their feet in an economi that is still not work the way we all want to see it and barrier of system racism make that even harder now I believ that presid obama doe not get the credit he deserv for lead us out of the great recess and I like to remind peopl he had noth to do with creat it in the first place He came into offic in thi worst of all financi crise sinc the great depress  wa hand to him and I think if you fairli look at the record you have to conclud that hi leadership save us from a great depress So as bad a thing becam  9 million job lost 5 million home lost 13 trillion in famili wealth wipe out  as bad as it wa there no tell how far down we would have gone without hi leadership So we are out of the ditch that we were in and now weve got to do even more weve got to build on the progress weve made 15 million new job in the last seven and a half year 20 million peopl now have health insur who did not have it befor he becam presid So weve got to have the will and the plan togeth to move forward that whi ive propos a comprehens new commit to african american and latino commun to make seriou sustain invest to creat more good pay job To help famili build and rebuild wealth to support black and latino own small busi for me these arent just econom issu theyr part of a long continu struggl for civil right rosa park open up everi seat on the bu now weve got to expand econom opportun so everyon can afford the fare and we have to make sure the bu rout reach everi neighborhood and connect famili with safe afford hous and good job sylvia mendez and rubi bridg help desegreg our school now weve got to help everi famili afford the book comput and internet access that our kid need to learn in the 21st centuri and so in my first 100 day as presid we will work with both parti to pass the biggest invest in new good pay job sinc world war II that includ job in manufactur clean energi technolog and innov small busi and infrastructur If we invest in infrastructur now we will not onli creat job today we will lay the foundat for the job of the futur were go to also focu on creat job and commun where unemploy remain stubbornli high after gener of underinvest and neglect Im a big fan of congressman jim clyburn 102030 plan steer 10 percent of feder invest to neighborhood where 20 percent of the popul ha been live below the poverti line for 30 year We need that kind of focus target invest in urban place rural place wherev american have been left out and left behind were also go to invest 20 billion in creat job for young peopl there a big gap here the unemploy rate among latino and african american youth is significantli higher than for white you know it hard to write a resum if you have noth to put on it were go to help our young peopl get that first job so they can get that second job so they can build a good solid middl class life that will give them and their famili a better futur were also go to do more to help black and latino entrepreneur get access to capit so they have a real chanc at turn their idea into thrive busi now I think that not onli good for those entrepreneur it good for their famili their worker and their commun addit as part of our end to end reform of the crimin justic system were go to help peopl succeed when they return home from jail or prison were go to ban the box so they can be judg by their skill and talent not by their past and we will dedic 5 billion to provid train and support to return citizen so they can get a good pay job and in my first 100 day Im go to introduc legisl for comprehens immigr reform with a path to citizenship that not onli the right thing to do everi independ analysi show it will add hundr of billion of dollar to our economi It will also keep famili togeth We need to bring hard work peopl out of the shadow america ha alway been a place where peopl from around the world work hard and appli their talent to american growth and innov in pursuit of their own dream So were go to do everyth we can to get thi done We need to build an economi and a futur that everi american can be proud of and be a part of an economi that work for everyon not just those at the top that will be my mission as presid these are just some of the highlight of our plan I hope you will go to my websit hillaryclintoncom to read the detail includ how we are go to pay for everyth I have propos and of cours I hope you will compar what Im propos to what my oppon is talk about now here one measur that you could use for that comparison An independ economist recent calcul that if my agenda for job and growth is put into place our economi would creat at least 104 million job within four year We actual think it could be more than that now thi economist also ran the number on donald trump includ hi disastr and inhuman plan to round up and deport million of hard work immigr the result accord to mark zandi who wa the econom advisor to john mccain dure hi 2008 run for the presid the result of trump plan would be a lengthi recess with 34 million job lost now of cours donald trump problem go far beyond econom At everi turn he stoke divis and resent He say horribl thing about one group of american after anoth he hearken back to the most shame chapter of our histori and appeal to the ugliest impuls of our societi you know the list youv report on it He start thi campaign by describ mexican immigr as crimin and rapist He retweet white nationalist He say a distinguish feder judg cant be trust becaus he is of mexican heritag He talk about ban muslim from come to the unit state a land built on religi freedom and ye he also talk about curtail press freedom as well We need to stand up as a countri and say that donald trump doesnt repres who we are and what we believ that is what my campaign what tim kain and I and everyon support us is do everyday and were go to keep at it becaus I believ with all my heart that america is better than thi america is better than donald trump We just launch an all spanish twitter account becaus we want to bring as mani american as possibl into thi convers weve open offic in everi state becaus we want to compet everywher We want to bring our messag and our vision to all corner of our countri but we cant do it alon everyon republican democrat and independ need to stand up and speak out now I think journalist have a special respons to our democraci in a time like thi As ida B well onc said peopl must know befor they can act and there is no educ to compar to the press now mani of you are show the way it a badg of honor when jorg ramo get thrown out of a press confer for challeng donald trump Or when anoth news organ get ban for report what he say As jorg said the best journal happen when you take a stand when you denounc injustic So I hope youll keep call it like you see it keep hold all of us account you know I have laid out all these plan and Im well awar that I have been sometim made fun of for put out these plan about the economi and educ and crimin justic reform and healthcar and gun safeti measur and all the rest of it but I do have thi old fashion idea when you run for presid you ought to tell the voter of america what you would do as presid So I am go to keep tell you what I would do becaus I want you to hold me account press and citizen alik becaus the stake are as high as theyv ever been in our lifetim and we all have to do our part So thank you for what you do everyday thank you for invit me to address you today and I look forward to take some of your question thank you all veri much great right it a great question and it one that I obvious have given much thought to becaus I am determin that we are go to achiev comprehens immigr reform with a path to citizenship So here is how I see it  first of all we are go to start immedi I want thi to be a clear high prioriti for my administr We will be prepar to introduc legisl as quickli as we can do so I am hope that the outcom of the elect which I am work hard to ensur a victori will send a clear messag to our republican friend that it time for them to quit stand in the way of immigr reform If you rememb after the 2012 elect the republican nation committe did what they call an autopsi of their loss and conclud that they could not continu to deni the import of immigr reform and they urg republican run for offic to get on board now that hasnt turn out the way that they seem to have hope We have instead a republican nomine who ha been virul anti immigr but there noth like win to chang mind and I think number one we have a good chanc of have a democrat senat if everybodi doe what I hope they will do and vote for democrat candid for the senat I believ we will pick up some seat in the hous and at least if not take it back narrow the number If we move in the senat and then we demand that there be a vote in the hous becaus I am convinc that if the bipartisan bill that had been achiev in the senat  rememb when marco rubio wa for it and peopl work hard and achiev it If it had been allow to come for a vote in the hous it would have pass So I view the polit landscap as increasingli favor to us make thi happen I will also defend the presid execut action I like you wa disappoint with the suprem court decis but rememb what it did it sent the case back to be tri It did not determin the case So daca and dapa are still aliv trump ha said one of hi first act as presid would be to elimin everi execut order that presid obama ha sign includ those on immigr issu So I will defend daca and dapa while I work vigor for immigr reform I have propos an offic of immigr affair for the white hous so that we are abl to answer question and provid inform and help peopl I will take a veri hard look at the deport prioriti My prioriti are violent crimin peopl suspect of ani kind of connect to terror not hard work mother and father and peopl who go to work help support thi economi pay 12 billion a year into social secur so we will take a hard look at that We will close privat detent center just like I want to end privat prison were go to close privat detent center So I have a veri activ agenda and were go to be move on it and I believ  and you know obvious it depend upon the outcom of thi elect  which is whi it so import to regist more voter My campaign is tri to regist 3 million more voter convinc peopl to turn out becaus were go to start earli and were go to be tenaci and absolut commit to get a posit result I think the chanc onc we win will improv dramat well look I think that the presid wa commit to immigr reform it one of the reason we got the bipartisan bill pass in the senat and what we didnt get though wa enough polit pressur to turn that bill into a vote issu in the 2010 midterm elect and here one of my frustrat peopl turn out to vote for presidenti elect and then often dont for midterm elect So we lost  we lost a lot of the leverag becaus we lost the hous of repres So noth happen easili or quickli in modern polit in america but here is what I know As I have said we are not go to be deport hard work peopl and breakup famili ive been on record for a yearanda half about thi and that will be how I direct the depart of homeland secur to act We are go to push on immigr reform and I will need not onli a consider vote in novemb but I will need peopl across our countri to make it clear to their elect repres that theyr go to be held account for how they are go to act on immigr reform We put enough organ and polit effort into thi I am optimist and I believ we can get thi done but it wont happen simpli becaus we want it and I can onli say that I will give you my veri best effort and I will do everyth I can to help elect a democrat senat ive alreadi talk to some of my former colleagu in the senat thi will be fasttrack We alreadi know what can pass the senat becaus it happen just a few year ago and if we then put enough pressur on the hous and do everyth we can to realli forc them to have to take what the senat pass I think the outcom will be veri differ thi time that my goal and that what Im go to do everi thing I can to achiev well kristin I appreci your ask that becaus I wa point out in both of those instanc that the director comey had said that my answer in my fbi interview were truth that realli the bottom line here and I have said on  dure the interview and in mani other occas over the past month that what I told the fbi  which he said wa truth  is consist with what I have said publicli So I may have short circuit it and for that I  you know will tri to clarifi becaus I think  you know chri wallac and I were probabl talk past each other be  becaus of cours he could onli talk to what I had told the fbi and I appreci that now I have acknowledg repeatedli that use two email account wa a mistak I  and I take respons for that but I do think you know have him say that my answer to the fbi were truth and then I should quickli add what I said wa consist with what I had said publicli and  and that realli sort of in my view tri to tie both end togeth well he  here  here what  here are the fact behind that as well you know that I presid I  I sent over 30000 email to the state depart that were workrel email director comey said that onli 3 out of 30000 had anyth resembl classifi marker what doe that mean well usual if ani of you have ever serv in the govern a classifi document ha a big head on the top which make veri clear what the classif is and in question director comey made the point that the 3 e mail out of the 30000 did not have the appropri mark and it wa therefor reason to conclud that anyon includ myself would have not  suspect that they were classifi and in fact I think that ha been discuss by other who have said two out of those three were later explain by the state depart not to have been in ani way confidenti at the time that they were deliv So that leav the 100 out of 30000 email that director comey testifi  contain classifi inform but again he acknowledg there were no mark on those 100 email and so what we have here is pretti much what I have been say throughout thi whole year and  and that is that I never sent or receiv anyth that wa mark classifi now if in retrospect which is what is behind the 100 number if in retrospect some differ agenc said but it should have been  although it wasnt  it should have been that what the debat about  is about but director comey said there wa absolut no intent on my part to either ignor or in ani way dismiss the import of those document becaus they werent mark classifi so that would have hard to do and I will go back to where I start I regret use one account ive taken respons for that but Im pleas to be abl to clarifi and explain what I think the bottom line is on thi well I had the great honor of work with mike morel spend a lot of hour with him in the situat room in the white hous He is a consumm profession who ha devot hi entir profession career to protect our countri I wa honor to receiv hi endors I will let hi comment speak for themselv but I  I realli appreci hi explain as he did in hi ope  some of what at stake in thi elect well I  I realli  I realli believ that the core of hi support  Im not go to speak for everyon who support him becaus I think there have been some quit distress statement come out of hi ralli and hi support and who ha align themselv with him  but I think the core of hi support realli center on the disappoint in the economi that so mani american feel and what I have been say is you know Im go to bring thi countri togeth I think we have three overarch goal we need more econom opportun we need to protect our nation secur and we have got to work toward american uniti So I have been tri to understand what it is that ha driven peopl to support trump and ive met with some peopl I have listen to them and so mani of them are look for an explan as to whi they lost the job they had for 18 year when the factori close and nobodi care about them what theyr go to do when their whole life wa spent mine coal and they made 80 thousand a year now they can bare find a job make minimum wage whi the center of so mani old industri town in america are hollow out and peopl are turn to opiat and heroin and the list goe on and that what ive heard So I think we have to recogn that of cours some of the appeal is xenophob and racist and misogynist and offens  we have to acknowledg that but let not lose sight of the real pain that mani american are feel becaus the economi ha left them behind So I have said  I said it again in my accept speech last thursday I want to be the presid for all american I want to lift up and give everybodi a chanc to pursu their dream and that mean peopl who are support him when I went to west virginia I knew that I wa not gonna win west virginia I can tell you that and I wa in a meet with a group of folk includ a coal miner who wa incred emot and talk to me and outsid there wa a big trump protest go on and one of the peopl at the protest for good sake wa blankenship who had just been convict of reckless indiffer toward the wellb of hi coal miner  caus death So clearli the line are pretti stark but I have said you know ive got a plan for coal countri ive got a plan for indian countri ive got a plan for inner citi ive got a plan for rural commun it one of the reason as I said in my remark that I support jim clyburn 102030 propos which would help all kind of commun in america jim and I have talk about thi So we have to reject and stand up against the appeal to the kind of bigotri and the use of bluster and bulli that we see come from trump campaign but let not forget the real econom challeng that too mani american of all background are face today So that how I think about it and that how Im go to tri in thi campaign to respond to and rebuk all of the horribl thing he say on a pretti regular basi  but not about me I could care less about that but when he goe after individu when he accus a distinguish feder judg of mexican heritag of not be fair when he insult a gold star famili of a muslim american who serv in the militari  you know the list I will stand up and call him out on that but I will also keep reach out to american of all race and ethnic and where ever they live to tell them that I am not go to forget about them after thi elect Im go work my heart out to help everi singl person have a better job with a rise incom and make sure their kid get a good educ and everyth els that I think theyr owe here in america well let me start by say everi time I have done a job peopl have count on me and trust me and at the convent last week we highlight the fight of my life start as a lawyer for the children defens fund take on the problem of juvenil in adult jail in south carolina segreg academi socal in alabama fight for kid with disabl to get an educ and all the way through the work I did as senat after 911 and repres all of you as secretari of state So there is  I  and I  I take thi serious dont you know dont doubt that I take it serious you know it doesnt make me feel good when peopl say those thing and I recogn that I have work to do but when I start run for the senat in new york a lot of the same thing were said I won I work hard for the peopl of new york and I wa reelect with 67 percent of the vote after I demonstr that I would be on their side I would fight for the peopl I repres I ran a realli hard campaign against barack obama as I think everybodi rememb It got a littl contenti from time to time and to my surpris he turn around ask me to be secretari of state becaus he trust me and then I serv as secretari of state and when I left I had a 66 percent approv rate So ask yourselv were 67 percent of the peopl in new york wrong were 66 percent of the american public wrong Or mayb just mayb when Im actual run for a job there is a real benefit to those on the other side in tri to stir up as much concern as possibl So I take it serious and Im go to work my heart out in thi campaign and as presid to produc result for peopl to get the economi to work for everybodi not just those at the top to do as much as I can to help peopl who as I said earlier may not even vote for me becaus I think our countri is at a crossroad elect presid obama said it extrem well both in what hi speech discuss in the convent what hi press confer sinc have point out thi is a crossroad elect there is so much at stake you can look at my record of public servic you can meet peopl and famili who were benefit by the children health insur program you can meet peopl who were benefit by reform the foster care and adopt system you can meet first respond and survivor from 911 who were benefit becaus I went to bat for them you can meet nation guard member and their famili who didnt have health care unless they were deploy befor I work with republican to fix that you can go down a long list and wed be happi to provid it to you of what I have done becaus I believ in public servic and I am proud that ive had the great great opportun to work on behalf of give more peopl a better life ever sinc I wa right out of law school So Im just go to get up everi day and make my case and I think therel be an opportun for a lot of peopl to actual hear it mmhmm Oh my gosh well could I tell you that I am bless to have a  a crew of great friend and ive had two chief of staff who were my africanamerican women friend maggi william and cheryl mill I have been bless to have peopl by my side in polit like minyon moor who is one of the leader of my campaign ive had a great group of young peopl who I have been realli motiv by and frankli learn from So I realli have had a lifetim of friendship go back to my colleg year when one of my best friend wa an africanamerican student so I cant compress into one convers  theyv support me theyv chastis me theyv rais issu with me theyv tri to expand my music tast So weve had  weve had a lot of  weve had a lot of great great time becaus of our friendship so I cant realli pick one convers out of you know 50 year of convers and I dont want to embarrass my friend peggi lewi is here she just becam the dean of commun at triniti washington and I want to congratul her donna brazil is here she our act chair of the dnc So I  I guess ill leav it at that I think Im go to  Im go to respect the code of friendship silenc but pleas know ive got a lot of great friend who have given me so much more well I take them serious becaus ive had the great privileg of work for mani year with latino leader activist busi men and women you know just as I respond to the question my first experi work on behalf of latino wa  well actual even befor I wa a legal servic lawyer through my church I babysat latino kid on saturday while their parent and older sibl went to the field outsid of my home in chicago which use to be  hard to believ now mile of farmland It wa my first real lesson in how much more we all have in common there I wa 11 or 12 year old babysit these littl kid and at the end of the day the old ramshackl bu stop at the end of the road and the parent and the older brother and sister got out and these littl kid just broke loos and start run down that road with their arm outstretch call for their mother and their father and get swept up in veri tire arm and then when I wa a littl bit older my church arrang exchang with latino church We would go into the citi of chicago sit in church basement talk about our live and again it reinforc what to me wa so much of a common sens of you know what we want in our live even though their live and mine were veri differ and as a legal servic lawyer  as the chair of the legal servic corpor we expand legal servic into place against a lot of polit opposit So I feel veri fortun that ive had the chanc to work with and learn from so mani latina and latino across america when I ran for the senat I work close with our elect repres both at the citi state and nation level I wa honor that they ralli around to support me and were part of the great victori that we had in the primari in new york So no I dont take ani voter for grant and I particularli dont take ani voter who is place their trust and confid in me for grant becaus I am go to get up as I said everi singl day and work my heart out to get the result that I have told you were go to achiev togeth and I know it hard ive been around as you all know veri well Im not new to thi It doesnt happen by hope it happen or wish it happen It happen by do everyth you possibl can and I am bless to have such close work relationship and friendship with latino leader tonight at my hous we will be have a big event with latino busi leader come from around america and so Im go to do what ive alway done you see I think at the core of polit leadership is relationship youv got to build relationship with individu and commun I know that doesnt happen by just ask for it It happen becaus you work hard to achiev it So Im go to do everyth I can to make sure that ani latino voter who vote for me know that Im go to be do my best to deliv on everyth that ive said and I will tell you as we go along what the challeng are becaus I may need to ask your help I may need you to put pressur on elect offici I may need you to flood the internet or flood the old fashion mailbox of elect repres So they know peopl are watch but that how were go to get it done and Im actual pretti confid and optimist about that So I hope that peopl will take thi elect serious becaus I sure take you serious and togeth I think we can creat the kind of futur that everyon of our kid and grandkid deserv thank you all veri much I am so happi to be back here and to have thi chanc to talk with all of you and to be introduc by two of the peopl that I admir most peopl who have realli made a differ in the live of so mani I know everybodi in iowa understand that tom and ruth harkin are as good as you can get there isnt anybodi better and I love serv with tom I had to confess that I miss the idea that hell be in the senat but you got to hear from patti judg and she would be a great senat for iowa I want to thank all the elect offici and parti offici who are here ive been in lincoln high school befor and Im glad to be back how mani of you saw the democrat convent ill tell you I had just the greatest sens of joy and pride as democrat took that stage and not just elect offici and peopl run for offic but so mani american who talk about their live and what they had gone through and what they had accomplish It wa posit It wa optimist It present a stark contrast to what we had seen the week befor at the republican convent and that whi in thi campaign Im cross the countri to talk about what we can do to improv the live of the vast major of american to creat more opportun for more peopl to live up to their own potenti and to pursu the american dream and I cant think of a better place to talk about that than right here in iowa becaus if you build it they will come after the convent my run mate and I tim kain got on a bu we went through pennsylvania and ohio stop at factori and busi talk to group listen  do a lot of listen  about what we need to do togeth and that whi ive roll out specif plan about how to creat more job to get incom rise In the first 100 day of my administr we will make the biggest invest in new job good pay job sinc world war II now how are we go to do that well were go to invest in infrastructur  our road our bridg our tunnel our port our airport these are good job and a lot of them are good union job with good pay and good benefit for famili you see I have thi oldfashion idea that the middl class of america is what make america economi work and what weve been see in recent year is a deliber effort to undermin the middl class some of it becaus of what call trickledown econom  cut tax for the wealthi get out of the way of corpor and that didnt work out so well did it some of it is becaus the incred effort to undermin the right to organ and bargain collect the american labor movement help to creat the american middl class So in addit to infrastructur that you can see were go to do water system were go to do sewer system We are also go to build a modern electr grid to take the clean renew energi that is produc in place like iowa and make sure it can be distribut where it can be use you know I  I am someon who believ that if we do infrastructur and we do clean renew energi job were go to be on the way to a 21st centuri economi that will work for everybodi not just those at the top and how do I know thi well becaus in the past weve done infrastructur havent we In fact we are live off the infrastructur built by our parent and our grandpar and in some case our greatgrandpar A lot of it is overdu  overdu for mainten overdu for upgrad So thi will be good for the economi as well as for individu worker and busi and how do I know about clean renew energi partli becaus I spent a lot of time in iowa last year anybodi who say to me well you know we cant realli transit to clean renew energi I ask them have you been to iowa late you alreadi get a third of your electr from wind and there go to be a lot of peopl who will be help by the kind of work were go to do to make sure that clean renew energi is avail around the countri and peopl who understand that know we can be the clean energi superpow of the 21st centuri and some peopl get a littl carri away have you notic that well I get carri away think about all the job were go to creat and all the famili that are go to have a better chanc for the futur I also get carri away by think about advanc manufactur becaus what happen in iowa wa not just put up the turbin you all figur out that you could actual put them togeth in iowa and employ peopl who are do that work and then train peopl in apprenticeship program at commun colleg to make sure you could maintain those turbin So the last time ive check there were about 10000 iowan work in clean renew energi the other thing were go to do is help small busi I just came from visit a great tshirt compani raygun right youv been there raygun met a young man from iowa who start that compani employ about 50 peopl right here in de moin ha store all across iowa I see anoth small businessman that I have gotten to know whose got hi own ballet bowl bowl alley thank you so much but here what weve got to do weve got to make sure that small busi particularli those start by young peopl get the credit they need and if theyv got student debt I want to put a three moratorium on their student debt payment so they can start their busi and see whether they can be success My dad wa a small businessman and I wa realli excit to see them make tshirt on silk screen becaus that what my dad did on a bigger scale when he had a littl print plant that print draperi fabric use silk screen I use to help him from time to time and I believ in small busi that whi I want to be a small busi presid and that a big contrast with donald trump who ha spent hi career stif small busi refus to pay the bill I dont know what would have happen in my famili if after my dad had work so hard he show up with the fabric that he print for the drape and they said sorri were not pay you honestli that is not how we do busi in america and so were go to stand up for small busi and help creat more of them to help creat more good job here in iowa and across america We are also go to make the economi fairer how are we go to do that were go to rais the nation minimum wage so it no longer a starvat wage We are also go to do what tom harkin ha stood for hi entir life were go to make sure peopl with disabl have job and opportun in thi economi and were go to make sure that women final get equal pay for the work we do So ye ive been lay out plan ever sinc I show up here in iowa back in april of 2015 and I am thrill to be the democrat nomine to be abl to campaign on those plan and take them to washington now ive got to tell you If you look at the plan ive laid out and one of independ analyst have done that here what they conclud under my plan well creat about 104 million new job in america under donald trump socal plan we will lose about three and a half million job now let me translat that into iowa becaus if you divid the countri by popul here in iowa you could gain 101000 job under my plan and lose more than 33000 job under donald trump plan So ive got to tell you what I believ which is that if we want to get the economi work for everybodi then we need a campaign that lay out the agenda so peopl can vote for it so that when Im elect I can tell the congress thi is what the peopl of america vote for us to do So I get pretti excit and pretti carri away enthusiast about what we can do becaus weve done it befor I couldnt believ all that neg pessimist talk come out of the republican convent I didnt know what countri they were talk about Of cours we have challeng ye We have problem of cours we do but there is noth america cant do if we decid to set some goal and pursu them becaus

will feel like the day after that elect if we have not come togeth to chart a cours of confid and optim that will realli get our economi work for everyon keep us safe and maintain american leadership around the world and unifi our countri that is what I will spend everi singl day work to achiev and with your help iowa we will win iowa We will win the elect and then we will work togeth for the futur we are seek thank you and god bless you thank you thank you so much I have to tell you I am thrill to be here for a number of reason first back in michigan  it wonder to be back in michigan you can realli feel the energi and dynam that is drive thi state to come back and in detroit weve got new busi open neighborhood like midtown and eastern market are come back the auto industri just had it best year ever over in ann arbor high tech firm are thrive the next gener of engin are get train up in houghton and here at futur amic so well name you are on the front line of what I believ will be a true manufactur renaiss in america I just wa give a short but excit tour by by mark jurcak and john couch who were tell me about how thi compani wa start as and for most of it earli histori wa an auto suppli compani and then in 2000 as the market began to chang and some of the auto compani began to realign they were face with a choic We all face choic in life dont we and thi compani could have just said hey you know our busi is not go to be what it wa weve got to just fold up let you know just kind of quit but that not what happen here and what happen here is what can happen across america you are in now what is larg an aerospac compani and  becaus of the workforc and the work ethic and the commit of futuram you are see the futur unfold So I got to see what happen here to help build the sl rocket that is go to go from macomb to mar I saw the two halv of an f35 nose cone wait to be put togeth I talk with some of the worker about the absolut perfect that is requir to do thi work and what I believ with all my heart is that what happen here can happen in so mani place if we put our mind to it if we support advanc manufactur if we are the kind of countri that onc again understand how import it is to build thing We are builder and we need to get back to build So were make progress none of us can be satisfi until the econom revit were see in some part of michigan reach everi commun but it is inspir to see thi combin of old fashion hard work and cut edg innov and I know my oppon in thi elect wa here in michigan about a week ago and it wa like he wa in a differ place when he visit detroit on monday he talk onli of failur poverti and crime He is miss so much about what make michigan great and the same is true when it come to our countri He describ america as an embarrass He said and I quot were becom a thirdworld countri look around you my friend Go visit with the worker build rocket that doesnt happen in thirdworld countri now we have a lot of urgent and import work to do and that what Im go to talk about today becaus all the peopl that I have met throughout thi campaign realli prove how wrong thi neg pessimist view is america best day are still ahead of us if we make up our mind to actual go out and make that happen just consid our asset We have the most dynam product workforc in the world bar none We have the most innov busi the top colleg univers commun colleg train program in the world and the best scienc and technolog We have enorm capac for clean energi product We are resili determin hardwork there is noth america cant do if we do it togeth and I  I know thi becaus thi is how I wa rais and I dont think Mr trump understand ani of it He hasnt offer ani credibl solut for the veri real econom challeng we face now those challeng emerg long befor the great recess and they have persist through our recoveri there is too much inequ too littl upward mobil it is just too hard to get ahead today but there are common sens thing that your govern could do that would give american more opportun to succeed whi dont we do it becaus power special interest and the tendenc to put ideolog ahead of polit progress ha led to gridlock in congress and how can you not be frustrat and even angri when you see noth get done and a lot of peopl feel no one is on their side and no one ha their back and that is not how it suppos to be in america If I am fortun enough to be your presid I will have your back everi singl day that I serv and my mission in the white hous will be to make our economi work for everyon not just those at the top thi is person for me I am the product of the american middl class I wa born in chicago I wa rais in a suburb but my grandfath work at the scranton lake mill in scranton pennsylvania for 50 year and becaus he work hard my dad wa abl to go to colleg and eventu start hi own small busi and then send me out into the world to follow my own dream no matter how far those dream have taken me I have alway rememb I am the daughter of a small busi owner and the granddaught of a factori worker and proud of both So here what I want I want everi american famili to be abl to tell the same stori If you work hard you do your part you should be abl to give your children all the opportun they deserv that is the basic bargain of america now whether we will be abl to renew that bargain on even better term for the 21st centuri depend in larg measur on the outcom of thi elect So here are four question that I hope the american peopl will ask of both candid and that the answer should help make your choic in novemb crystal clear first which candid ha a real plan to creat good pay job second who will restor fair into our economi and ensur that those at the top pay their fair share of tax third who will realli go to bat for work famili and fourth who can bring peopl togeth to deliv the result that will make a differ in your live now now I hope that after give a fair hear to both side you will join the million of peopl across our countri support thi campaign not just democrat but a grow number of republican and independ as well now when it come to creat job I would argu it not even close even conserv expert say trump agenda will pull our economi back into recess and accord to an independ analysi by a former econom advisor to senat john mccain if you add up all of trump idea from cut tax for the wealthi and corpor to start a trade war with china to deport million of hardwork immigr the result would be a loss of 31 million job now by contrast the same analyst found that with our plan the economi would creat more than 10 million new job So let me tell you how we would do that I believ everi american will to work hard should be abl to find a job that provid digniti pride and decent pay that can support a famili So start on day one we will work with both parti to pass the biggest invest in new good pay job sinc world war II We will put american to work build and modern our road our bridg our tunnel our railway our port our airport We are way overdu for thi my friend We are live off the invest that were made by our parent and grandpar gener We will also help citi like detroit and flint connect underserv neighborhood to opportun expand afford hous and we will repair school and fail water system as well you know I happen to think we should be ambiti while were at it let connect everi household in america to broadband by the year 2020 it astonish to me how mani place in america not way way far away from citi but in citi and near citi that dont have access to broadband and that disadvantag kid who are ask to do homework use the internet five million of them live in home without access to the internet So you talk about an achiev gap It start right there and let build a cleaner more resili power grid with enough renew energi to power everi home in our countri as well some countri is go to be the clean energi super power of the 21st centuri and creat million of job and busi it probabl go to be either china germani or america I want it to be us We invent the technolog we should make it and use it and export it which will help to grow our economi and here someth that you dont alway hear enough of from democrat a big part of our plan will be unleash the power of the privat sector to creat more job at higher pay and that mean for us creat an infrastructur bank to get privat fund off the sidelin and compliment our privat invest twentyf billion dollar in govern seed fund could a lot more than 250 billion and realli get our countri move on our infrastructur plan and were go to invest 10 billion in what were call make It in america partnership to support american manufactur and recommit to scientif research that can creat entir new industri when mark and john were give me the tour and I wa talk to some of the worker along the way and ask them where some of the precis machineri came from that is be use here at futuram It what I hear all over the countri germani japan itali I want to bring that precis manufactur back to the unit state there is no reason we cant begin to make those machin ourselv and suppli the rest of the world instead of buy from somewher els let also expand incent like the new market tax credit that can bring busi govern and commun togeth to creat good job in place that have been left out and left behind from neglect neighborhood in detroit and flint to log countri coal countri nativ american commun from rural area ravag by addict and lost job to industri region hollow out when factori close As presid I will also make a major push to empow small busi and entrepreneur with  with new nation initi to cut red tape at everi level and expand access to credit especi through commun bank and credit union I will propos a new plan to dramat simplifi tax file for small busi right now the smallest busi the kind that my dad had  it wa a realli small busi  spent 20 time more per employe to prepar their tax compar to larger compani It should be as easi as print out a bank statement let free entrepreneur to do what they do best initi grow and hire As mark said thi compani start becaus of a drive down a road and think about it talk about it then see one of the old oldsmobil futuram and decid  hey not onli do I have an idea ive got a name In america if you can dream it you should be abl to build it and were go to get back to do that now donald trump ha a differ view he made a career out of stif small busi from atlant citi to la vega there are compani that were left hang becaus he refus to pay their bill A lot of those compani scrape togeth what they could to pay their employe and mani of them put their busi at risk and someon of them end up take bankruptci It wasnt becaus trump couldnt pay them it wa becaus he wouldnt pay them and that whi I take it person My dad ran a print plant he had two realli long tabl he print fabric for draperi he would lay out the fabric and then he would take a silk screen and he would go down the tabl hed put the silk screen down and hed pour the paint in hed take the squeege hed go across the screen hed lift it up hed go down  go down all the way to the end and then he would start on the other tabl he work hard and then when he finish he would load all that fabric up put it in hi car and take it to the busi that had order it mayb a restaur or a hotel or some offic He expect to be paid when he show up he did the work he paid for the suppli and the labor that he often hire to help him on big job he expect to be paid I cant imagin what would have happen to my father and hi busi if he had got a contract from trump and show up and submit hi bill had been told were not go to pay and if you dont like it sue us my father never could have su a big organ like that I just dont understand it ive met all kind of worker painter plumber ive met small busi that provid piano instal glass or marbl all of whom were deni payment and after go back time and again be told well mayb well pay you 30 cent on the dollar or 50 cent on the dollar that not how we do busi in america So weve got to creat more good job that are go to help more peopl for exampl our modern servic economi is empow consum with more choic than greater flexibl but we do have to empow the worker in our servic sector too the peopl take care of our children and our parent they deserv a good wage and good benefit and a secur retir and it crucial that everi american have access to the educ and skill they need to get the job of the futur so we will fight to make colleg tuition free for the middl class and debt free for everyon We will also liber million of peopl who alreadi have student debt by make it easier to refin and repay what you owe as a portion of your incom so dont have to pay more than you can afford It  it is just not right that donald trump can ignor hi debt but student and famili cant refin their debt and here someth els that I realli want to emphas I dont think anybodi in america is talk about thi enough and that is a fouryear degre should not be the onli path to a good job in america you should be abl to learn a skill practic a trade make a good live do it So mani american have the talent and the will to succeed whether theyr kid right out of high school or older peopl displac by autom and outsourc and for too long big promis about the power of train and retrain havent deliv like they should It doesnt help anybodi to be train for a job that doesnt exist So here what were gonna do We will support highqual union train program we will propos We will propos new tax credit to encourag more compani to offer paid apprenticeship that let you earn while you learn We will do more includ a nation campaign to dignifi skill train across the board I  I think we gotta revers what ha becom a kind of you know common place view which is everybodi need to go to colleg well in fact more than half of the job that are go to be avail in 2020 do not requir a colleg fouryear degre So for welder and machinist and tool and dye maker and health technician and coder and so mani other let get the word out there are realli good job for peopl right now and there will be more in the futur if you get the skill in high school at commun colleg in an apprenticeship or other train program and I  I wanna acknowledg the great role that the commun colleg here in macomb counti ha play in work with compani like thi one to make sure peopl do have the skill now I imagin some of you might be think well that all sound good but what about trade after all trump talk about it all the time well let start with thi It is true that too often past trade deal have been sold to the american peopl with rosi scenario that did not pan out those promis now bring hollow in mani commun across michigan and our countri that have seen factori close and job disappear too mani compani lobbi for trade deal so they could sell product abroad but then they instead move abroad and sold back into the unit state It is also true that china and other countri have game the system for too long enforc particularli dure the bush administr ha been too lax invest at home that would make us more competit have been complet block in congress and american worker in commun have paid the price but the answer is not to rant and rave or cut ourselv off from the world that would end up kill even more job the answer is to final make trade work for us not against us So my messag My messag to everi worker in michigan and across america is thi I will stop ani trade deal that kill job or hold down wage includ the transpacif partnership I oppos it now ill oppos it after the elect and ill oppos it as presid As a senat from new york I fought to defend new york manufactur and steel maker from unfair chines trade practic and I oppos the onli multilater trade deal that came befor the senat while I wa there becaus it didnt meet my high bar and as secretari of state I fought hard for american busi to get a fair shot around the world and to stop underhand trade practic like currenc manipul and the theft of intellectu properti So as presid I will stand up to china and anyon els who tri to take advantag of american worker and compani and I am go to ramp up enforc by appoint for the first time a cheap trade prosecutor I will tripl the number of enforc offic and when countri break the rule  we wont hesit to impos target tariff now Mr trump may talk of big game on trade but hi approach when it come to trade is base on fear not strength fear that we cannot compet with the rest of the world even when rule are fair fear that our countri ha no choic but to hide behind wall If team usa wa as fear as trump michael phelp and simon bile would be cower in the locker room afraid to come out and compet instead they are win gold medal america isnt afraid to compet right now thousand of michigan compani are export billion of dollar of product around the world We want them to sell even more and creat even more job here at home but corpor should not abandon profit oper in the unit state to move abroad just to give sharehold a quicker return ceo a bigger bonu and union a weaker hand to play now befor he tweet about how he is realli the one who will put america first and trade let rememb where trump make mani of hi own product becaus it sure is not america He ha made trump tie in china and trump suit in mexico instead of here in michigan He keep say it not possibl to make these thing in america anymor that just wrong So we creat a websit hillaryclintoncommakeither On it we list 100 place across the unit state that are alreadi produc similar good one posit thing trump could do to make america great again is to actual make great thing in america again now let look at the second question which candid will fight for fair and thi is an urgent need we need to grow the economi and make it fairer the tide is not rise fast enough and certainli not lift all boat sinc the crash too mani of the gain have gone to the top one percent the rule and incent in our system reward corpor for put shortterm stock price abov long time invest in their worker equip and research while corpor profit are at near record high paycheck for most peopl have bare budg incom arent grow fast enough to keep up with the cost of live for thing like prescript drug and childcar I believ everi employe from the ceo suit to the factori floor contribut to a busi success So everyon should share in the reward especi those put in long hour for littl pay So Im propos a new tax credit to encourag more compani to share profit with more and more broadli we will fight for a more progress or patriot tax code that put american job first right now when a corpor outsourc job and product it could write off the cost We must stop that and we must make them pay back ani tax break they ever receiv them from ani level of govern in our countri and for those that move their headquart oversea to avoid pay their fair share of tax theyr go to have to pay a new exit tax So if they want to go theyr go to have to pay to go and wall street corpor and the super rich should final pay their fair share of tax that whi I support the socal buffet rule becaus multimillionair should not be abl to pay a lower tax rate than their secretari We should also add a new tax on multimillionair crack down on tax game by corpor and close the carri interest loop hole someth ive advoc for year now compar what trump say now there is a myth out there that he will stick it to the rich and power becaus somehow he realli on the side of the littl guy dont believ it not when he pledg to rip up basic rule that hold corpor account when he want to scrap regul that stop pollut from poison the air our children breath and the water we drink let insur compani write their own rule again trump would roll back the tough rule that we have impos on the financi industri ill do the opposit I think we should strengthen those rule so wall street can never wreck main street again trump even want to abolish the consum financi protect bureau A new agenc that ha alreadi return more than 11 billion to 25 million american who were taken advantag of by corpor whi would you get rid of that and then there is trump tax plan He would give trillion in tax cut to big corpor millionair and wall street money manag that would explod our nation debt and eventu lead to massiv cut in prioriti like educ healthcar and environment protect In hi speech on monday he call for a new tax loop hole let talk it the trump loop hole becaus it would allow him to pay less than half the current tax rate on incom from mani of hi compani hed pay a lower rate than million of middl class famili one non partisan expert at the tax polici center describ thi plan as and I quot a realli nice deal for donald trump Of cours it hard to say how nice becaus he refus to do what everi other presidenti candid in decad ha done and releas hi tax return but we do know that the 400 richest tax payer in america would get an averag tax cut of more than 15 million a year from the trump loop hole and then there the estat tax which trump want to elimin all togeth now if you believ that he as wealthi as he say that alon would save the trump famili 4 billion It would do noth for 998 percent of american So theyd get a 4 billion tax cut and 998 percent of american would get noth just think of what we could do with those 4 billion We could pay for more than 47000 veteran to get a four year colleg degre We could provid a year worth of healthcar to nearli three million kid Or we could fund a year worth of feder assist to state and local law enforc I think there are a lot of better way to spend the money On monday Im go to be in scranton pennsylvania with vice presid biden and he ha a say dont tell me what you valu show me your budget and I will tell you what you valu well  donald trump want to give trillion in tax break to peopl like himself I want to invest it in veteran our kid our polic offic and so much more and you can then draw your own conclus about valu now it true that both of us have propos to cut tax for middl class famili he make a big promis but hi advis have said  hi own advis have said he may not stand by them instead the tax cut he doubledown on in hi speech in detroit on monday offer trillion to the richest american and corpor and one of the differ between donald trump and me is Im tell you what I will do Im lay out my plan and I will stand by them and want you to hold me account for deliv result you know thi all remind me of that old say if it sound too good to be true it probabl is and that bring us to the third question which candid can you actual count on to go to bat for worker and work famili It is not enough to pay lip servic to be on your side We have to recogn how american actual live and work in the 21st centuri and then offer real solut that make your live easier We know that women are now the sole or primari breadwinn in a grow number of famili We know more american are cobbl togeth parttim work or strike out on their own So we have to make it easier to be good worker good parent and good caregiv all at the same time that whi ive set out a bold vision to make qualiti afford childcar avail to all american and limit the cost to 10 percent of famili incom On monday trump offer hi first real idea on thi topic becaus previous he had dismiss concern about childcar He said it wa quot not an expens thing becaus you just need some block and some swing now he say he want to exclud childcar payment from taxat hi plan wa pan from the left the right the center becaus it transpar is design for rich peopl like him He would give wealthi famili 30 or 40 cent on the dollar for their nanni and littl or noth for million of hardwork famili tri to afford childcar so that they can get to work and keep the job I think instead we should expand the child tax credit to provid real relief to ten of million of work famili struggl with the cost of rais children  the same famili that hi plan ignor and that just a start becaus the more we do to help work famili the more our entir economi will benefit for exampl guarante equal pay wont just increas paycheck for women it will boost famili budget and get incom rise across the board and I dont understand whi trump is against that paid famili leav will not onli make life easier for mom and dad it will also keep skill talent american in the workforc and grow our economi that whi everi other advanc countri alreadi ha it again he against it rais the feder minimum wage wont just put more money in the pocket of lowincom famili it also mean they will spend more at the busi in their neighborhood thi is  thi is someth that even the origin automak understood way back at the begin of the 20th centuri when they decid to pay the unbeliev sum of 5 a day to autowork and when they were critic by other busi  how can you pay that much they had the best answer We want peopl to be abl to buy our car thi is econom 101 We need to get incom and wage rise and it will help the whole economi grow and be fairer and protect and expand social secur doesnt just help older american retir with digniti It help to eas burden on famili and commun and I also believ the same thing about comprehens immigr reform We alreadi have million of peopl work in the economi and pay 12 billion a year to social secur even though they are undocu So by move toward reform we will unleash a lot of new incom and growth and we will level the play field so that american worker cannot be taken advantag of becaus undocu worker can be exploit by employ which is one of the reason we have thi disconnect and final strengthen union doe not just serv member it lead to better pay and benefit and work condit for all employe So I have also said I will defend and improv the afford care act for me that includ give american in everi state the choic of a public option health insur plan that will help everyon afford coverag It will strengthen competit and drive down cost now these are all caus I have work on for decad and I believ they point to a fundament truth about the economi It can seem like zero sum  when you are compet for a job promot or contract if someon win and someon lose but that is not the full pictur if you step back you can see we are all in thi togeth If we grow togeth we can all rise togeth and you know what I like to say we are all stronger togeth the fourth question is key and it thi who can bring peopl togeth to get ani of thi done right well  I believ I can becaus I think I can provid seriou steadi leadership that can provid common ground to build on it base upon hard but respect bargain with the other side leadership that rise abov person attack and namecal not revel in it I just do not think insult and bulli is how we are to get thing done I do not think that that is the appropri approach for us I know it hard to imagin but there wa a time when democrat and republican actual work togeth I know that true I did it as first ladi senat and secretari of state It is how we creat the children health insur program which cover eight million kid It is how we rebuilt new york after 911 and how we pass a treati to reduc the threat from russia nuclear weapon So I am convinc base on my experi that we can do thi one of the reason that I ask senat tim kain to be my run mate is that he also ha a record of work across the aisl to get thing done as a mayor governor and a senat So we are go to make full use of the white hous power to conven We are go to get everyon at the tabl not just republican and democrat but busi and labor union academ but most importantli american like all you I think there are a lot of great idea out in america and I want you to have a say and that mean weve got to get unaccount money out of polit overturn citizen unit and expand vote right not restrict them I intend start even befor the elect to bring togeth leader from across the economi from a lot of differ place to talk about job and competit I hope mark and john can join me becaus we need the best idea that are out there make a differ  We need to pull togeth the bottomlin is thi I am run for presid to build an economi that work for everyon not just those at the top and base on what we know from the trump campaign he want american to work for him and hi friend at the expens of everyon els He ha offer no credibl plan to address what work famili are up against today noth on student loan or the cost of descript drug noth for farmer or struggl rural commun noth to build a new futur with clean energi and advanc agricultur noth for commun of color in our citi to overcom the barrier of system racism noth to creat new opportun for young all It is just a more extrem version of the fail theori of trickl down econom with hi own addit of outlandish trumpian idea that even republican reject and as we heard him say at hi convent he may believ that he alon can fix our countri but clearli he doesnt know the peopl of michigan He doesnt see the busi and the labor union the local govern the clergi come

vice presid and senat in quiet moment with constitu and in the situat room help to make decis that affect our live and secur and wherev he goe he alway the same guy a fighter for everyon a champion for town like scranton and abov all a fighter for famili and you know I think hed be the first to say that he care about your famili becaus of hi famili joe senior and catherin taught joe that all peopl deserv to be treat with digniti when you see someon fall you help them back up becaus we are all in thi togeth that is the biden way We have seen how he fight for work famili becaus he passion believ in the basic bargain that make america great that our economi should work for everyon not just those at the top He stand up against injustic He ha led the fight to end violenc against women and girl and he stand up for peopl live and health includ the project he now leader on behalf of presid obama the cancer moonshot to fund breakthrough and save live As mani of you know hi wonder son beau a great father a great public servant a great human be pass away last year so thi is person to joe biden He know it person to a lot of famili that whi he fight so hard to make a differ and if Im elect thi fall Im go to ask joe to continu the import work he begun to help us fight and defeat cancer So as someon who ha work with joe for year first in the senat then as a member of the obamabiden cabinet I can attest to that passion for stand up for peopl tri to make live better it what push him to work as hard as he can everi second of everi day for all of us and joe and hi wonder wife jill have rais their children and grandchildren with those same valu So joe I hope you know how much not just scranton but america love you and your famili So it mean a great deal to have him by my side you know when joe and I were decid where to have our first campaign ralli there realli wa onli one answer scranton isnt just joe hometown it my dad hometown too while the biden were on north washington avenu my famili the rodham were a few block away on diamond avenu I wa christen at the methodist church on court street My grandfath went to work at the scranton lace mill start as a teenag It wasnt easi work but you know what I learn that busi treat it worker right believ it or not the scranton lace compani all those year ago actual offer a profit share plan and health benefit at the begin of the 20th centuri they understood someth that a lot of folk have forgotten they understood that their worker were respons for much of the busi success so it wa onli fair that they share in that success and that their famili benefit too and becaus of that job my grandfath could give my father a better life My father wa abl to go to colleg went to penn state where he play footbal then after he got out of penn state it wa 1935 right in the depth of the depress and he wa look for a job He heard a friend of hi knew somebodi who heard that somebodi wa hire in chicago so he liter hop a freight train from scranton to chicago  I dont recommend that anymor  where he got a job as a salesman He went into the navi dure world war II and when he got out he start a small busi in chicago where I grew up and just like hi father befor him my dad wa determin to give us even greater opportun than he had and to me that is the american dream No matter where life take me I alway rememb I am the granddaught of a factori worker and the daughter of a small busi owner and I am so proud of it and you know the stori of the rodham and the biden isnt uniqu what uniqu is the countri where those stori were written No matter what donald trump say america is great and the american dream is big enough for everyon to share in it promis but that doesnt mean we can take it for grant and just wait until it happen to us We have a lot of work to do here in scranton you know that presid obama and vice presid biden pull us back from the worst financi crisi sinc the great depress and put our economi back on a stronger foot I person dont think they get enough credit for that under their leadership weve creat 15 million new privat sector job 20 million peopl now have health care and the auto industri just had it best year ever So I think the job of the next presid is to build on that but to take on the deeper challeng that emerg long befor the crisi and have persist through our recoveri inequ is too high wage are too low It is still too hard for too mani to get ahead So my top prioriti is creat an economi that work for everyon not just those at the top which is whi ive set five ambiti goal to get us there first we are go to make the biggest invest in new goodpay job sinc world war II second were go to make colleg debtfre for all and help million of peopl struggl with exist student debt third were go to crack down on compani that shift job and profit oversea and were go to reward compani that share profit with their employe like the scranton lace compani did almost a centuri ago fourth fourth thank you fourth were go to make sure that wall street corpor and the super rich final pay their fair share of tax and fifth were go to respond to the way american famili actual live and work today by make childcar afford becaus in today economi there is often no parent or grandpar stay home with the kid and were go to fight for paid famili leav becaus sometim you need to take care of your child or your spous or sick parent and you should not lose your job for take care of the love one now you know whenev I mention these issu you know donald trump alway said that Im play the woman card well you know what I say if that play the woman card then deal me in I realli believ that togeth thi plan will go a long way toward build a stronger fairer economi where everyon can contribut to it growth everyon can share in it reward now by contrast what trump plan well he laid it out last week and ill admit even befor he did I didnt think it wa go to be good for work american but it turn out to be wors than I ever imagin I know some of you may have friend up here in north eastern pennsylvania who are think about vote for trump you know I know I know friend should not let friend vote for trump but just in care you can have a convers explain that donald trump would give trillion  that trillion with a T  in tax cut to big corpor millionair and wall street money manag that would explod the nation debt and it would lead to massiv cut in thing like educ and healthcar he even call for a new tax loophol let call it the trump loophol becaus it would allow trump to pay less than half the current tax rate on incom for mani of hi compani a pretti sweet deal He would end up pay a rate lower than million of middleclass famili now that is assum he pay ani tax at all becaus we realli dont know becaus we havent seen hi tax return but we do know just by look at the data we know that the 400 richest taxpay in america would get an averag tax cut of more than 15 million a year from the trump loophol and then of cours there the estat tax that trump want to elimin all togeth now if you believ that he as wealthi as he claim that would save the trump famili 4 billion but it would do noth for 998 percent of all the other american in our countri So ye 4 billion tax cut for trump 998 percent of american get noth think of what we could do with those 4 billion We could pay for more than 47000 veteran to get a fouryear colleg degre We could provid a year  year worth of healthcar to nearli 3 million kid Or we could fund a year worth of feder assist to state and law  local law enforc So there are a lot of better way to spend the money and there one more part of trump plan that I want to mention he now say he want to help peopl pay for child care by exclud those payment from taxat well again guess who that will help the most it will help rich peopl who will get 30 to 40 cent on the dollar to pay for their nanni hardwork famili who cant afford childcar in the first place well get littl to no real help that whi hi childcar plan ha been pan by expert across the polit spectrum left right and center becaus rememb right now childcar cost as much as in state colleg tuition in most of the countri So we need real solut that will work for work peopl not just the well off and to prove that he realli care about thi issu trump made a point about talk about how hi busi offer on site child care to worker well that kind of perk me up becaus if he realli did that it would be a big deal I wish more compani would provid onsit childcar that would be a huge benefit for employe but like so much of what he say is not true It turn out some of hi resort hotel and club offer child care servic but for guest not employe just say If you stay at a trump hotel you could enrol your kid in someth call trump kid they will get special children room servic children spa servic even a nanni for a fee but if you work for hi busi if you clean the room water the lawn carri peopl bag you get noth Im not even sure trump know that provid a trump kid program for pay custom is not the same thing as provid real child care for your worker just like hi tax break for billionair arent the same as a real plan to help america work famili you know vice presid biden ha a say I love dont tell me what you valu show me your budget and ill tell you what you valu No it pretti clear donald trump want to give trillion of tax break to peopl like himself not invest in our veteran our kid our polic offic our teacher and anyon who realli provid servic and we have real seriou challeng in america We need seriou leadership thi is not a realiti TV show it as real as it get look at what happen in milwauke right now weve got urgent work to do to rebuild trust between polic and commun ad get back to the fundament principl  everyon should have respect for the law and be respect by the law So on all these import challeng you have to ask yourself is trump up to the job he give a speech  he give a speech about isi today now ive laid out my strategi for defeat isi over mani month We will strike their sanctuari from the air and support local forc take them out on the ground under presid obama and vice presid biden we are make progress we will surg our intellig so we detect and prevent attack befor they happen We will disrupt their effort onlin to reach and radic young peopl in our countri It wont be easi or quick but make no mistak we will prevail there is no doubt in my mind and onc again in comparison donald been all over the place on isi He talk about let syria becom a freezon for isi a major countri in the middl east that could launch attack against us and other he talk about send ground troop american ground troop  well that is off the tabl as far as I am concern So well wait and see what he say today but sometim he say he wont tell anyon what hell do becaus he want to keep hi plan quot secret and then it turn out the secret is he ha no plan and that wa veri clear when he said I know more about isi than the gener No donald you dont and on top of that he say more countri should have nuclear weapon includ in the middl east He talk about walk away from our european alli He ha the temer to say that the unit state militari is a disast well I wish hed spent as much time as joe and I have meet the brave young men and women who serv in the militari meet their famili meet with gold star famili those are not the word of someon who respect our militari and the sacrific that our young men and women make everi singl day I said in philadelphia that a man you can bait with a tweet is not a man you can trust with nuclear weapon it also not a man you can trust to run our economi help heal our citi or be a role model for our children there is no doubt donald trump is temperament unfit and total unqualifi to be presid of the unit state and commanderinchief So my friend america deserv a presid who can get the job done bring our countri togeth not tear it apart deliv real result for hardwork american and we cant win thi elect without you that whi Im ask you to join right now take out your phone and text join247246 Or go

deserv and I am so sure we can do thi especi with thi man fight alongsid us just like he alway ha So scranton pleas let give it up for the vicepresid of the unit state joe biden hello philadelphia wow I  thank you thank you thank you so much I  I am so excit to be back in the citi that host the greatest convent I  I cant tell you as ive been travel across the countri how mani peopl have said to me

everybodi across pennsylvania to be part of a great victori in novemb and then the futur that were go to build togeth have ani of you been watch the olymp well ive got to tell you I am a big olymp fan I  those athlet what they give up the sacrific the work I understand that philadelphia own nia ali just made the first round heat in the 100 meter hurdl today team usa is show the world what thi countri stand for I am proud of our team there and Im proud of the incred teamwork that they show I wa think the other day when donald trump speak he speak about fear he speak about such neg and such pessim and then I watch the olymp and it exactli the opposit you have young peopl go out do their best everi day to get prepar to compet and that what were go to do in america there is noth we cant do if we put our mind to it I I wa up in scranton yesterday with vice presid joe biden and we had a great day both joe and I have in scranton so we saw a lot of peopl that were relat to a lot of    how do you do it they see me on TV and on tape and Im in anoth state then Im in anoth state and Im lucki I can sleep on    and held but what it realli all about is get up everyday and be motiv to make sure that everi person and everi person in thi commonwealth and everi person in thi countri ha the same chanc to live up to your dream the same opportun that previou gener of american enjoy   educ in the audienc who make dream come true becaus actual so I know what we can do togeth but how are we go to pay for it well ill tell you how were go to pay for it were go where the money is were go after the super wealthi were go after the corpor were go after wall street so they pay their fair share that whi I wa so surpris when donald trump came out and talk about the economi becaus actual he would give trillion of dollar in more tax break to the wealthi He want a new tax loophol that we call the trump loophol that would actual help him and everybodi els who is realli wealthi to cut their tax rate in half on a lot of their incom He want to elimin the estat tax which doe noth for 998 percent of all american but you know if trump is as wealthi as he claim to be it would save hi famili 4 billion I got to tell you 4 billion earli childhood help our veteran help our law enforc do what they need to do help more peopl get the job train and the skill train In fact we could hire 95000 public school teacher for 4 billion We could actual  health care for our veteran for 4 billion and we could invest in afford hous and small busi for 4 billion right here in pennsylvania So I think we know what we need to do the question is whether we will do it and that all come down to who show up and vote that whi we have been regist voter in our campaign We launch a drive to regist 3 million voter and get those voter to commit to vote It doesnt do you ani good if your regist and you dont show up right So weve got peopl wave over there theyv got their voter registr form for you and we want you to be part of thi So here what Im ask Im ask you to regist yourself and Im ask you to ask everybodi you know to regist becaus when we do that we make a commit that we care about what gonna happen in thi elect and we also care about win back the senat that make the senat democrat again   and tri to pick up some more democrat in the hous of repres that will help too you see I have thi oldfashion idea look at our last two democrat presid presid obama and   and a guy name clinton that we got a lot done for america when they were in offic right you know when I hear folk critic presid obama Im think well what dont they like they dont like the fact that he help save the economi from the worst financi crash sinc the 1930 they dont like the fact we now have 20 million more peopl who have access to afford health care they dont like the fact that hi intervent save the auto industri and impos the toughest new rule on wall street what dont they like when I hear peopl critic bill I think what dont they like the peac or the prosper it kind of hard to know So dont be complac my friend becaus even though were do fine right now Im not take anybodi anywher for grant were go to work hard these next 85 day and I cant do it without your help now we have packet for you at the door so you can also canvass meet your neighbor canvass across west philli after thi event thi even were open our southwest philli offic on 52nd and cedar stop by the deadlin for regist is octob the 11 So we have work to do but here what I promis you I promis you that were go to go not onli as hard as we can to win thi elect but then to go as hard as we can to achiev the result that the countri need and that whi I talk specif about what I want to do I know that some peopl make fun of me they say oh she ha all these plan and you can go to my websit and read my plan but ill tell you  you know whi I do that becaus I want you to know what Im go to tri to do so you can both help me and hold me account for do what I told you I want to do We want to creat million of new good job and infrastructur becaus our road our bridg our tunnel our port our airport are fall apart our water system our sewer system are fall apart and we also need a new modern electr grid to be abl to take and distribut all the clean renew energi that were go to be produc and when peopl say to me we cant bring manufactur back to the unit state I say but ive seen it I have seen what we can do I have been in plant in pennsylvania in ohio across america who are do just that and when I meet the peopl there such pride and digniti when I wa in johnstown wire technolog on our bu trip with tim kain and I met peopl work there I met a young marin veteran he been there now a coupl of year He is as proud as he can be becaus he make someth that realli make a differ and that is export around the world from johnstown pennsylvania So dont tell me we cant make thing I know we can I wa in a plant outsid of detroit last week It use to be an autosuppli plant then in 2000  it wa start in 1955 by the grandfath of the guy who the chair of their board now In 1955 they start they were make auto part then in 2000 their main custom one of the auto maker move a lot of their product  now they could have been realli just broken by that they could have said you know what we gotta close up shop but that not what they did they were so determin to keep that busi go So they said what skill do we have what can we do now and they got into the aerospac busi there I saw the nosecon of a f35 there I saw the part theyr make for nasa for the rocket that will take astronaut on the man mission to mar In warren michigan a place that use to make auto part which is now liter make rocket part and you know what I thought I thought wait a minut thi could have been one of those sort of poor me stori you know we cant do it we cant compet but instead peopl got up and said ye we can and ye they did right and I start look at the machin that they were use a lot of precis machin made in germani made in japan made in itali I said to the worker there could we make those machin they said you bet we could If we have the right partnership between our govern and manufactur we can have a renaiss in manufactur and job that will give peopl good live and the pride and digniti of work and here someth we dont say often enough more than half of the job that are predict for 2020 are not go to requir a four year colleg degre So I want to make colleg afford for everybodi and were go to get that done I want to help you refin and pay down your student debt if you alreadi have that but I also want to make sure commun colleg is free and we have more technic educ back in our high school I want us to have more apprenticeship so that more young peopl get the skill that they can use to fill those job in 2020 So I am optimist and anoth big area where Im optimist is green renew energi where were go to be the 21st centuri clean energi super power not china not germani the unit state of america So I know we can do thi We got ourselv out of the worst financi crash were stand now were go to start run again and we are particularli go to focu on young peopl who have been left out of educ and the job market and middl age and older peopl who have lost job and need new skill to be abl to compet and win again in the job market and while were do that were go to start at the veri begin with earli childhood educ univers prekindergarten becaus we are stronger togeth and we need all of our peopl to feel that theyv got a shot you know even abraham lincoln talk about how import it wa   give everi american a fair shot in the race of life that what weve got to get back to it just wrong that some peopl do well and other peopl feel like theyr never go to catch up So I want to be a presid for not onli democrat but republican and independ too I want to be a presid for the struggl the strive and the success I want to be a presid for those who vote for me and those who dont vote for me becaus we are all in thi togeth So there a lot we could do on the economi there a lot we can do on educ there a lot we could do on healthcar We are go to build on the afford care act and were go to get the cost of premium copay and deduct down and we are go to tackl the high cost of prescript drug and we are go to do more to help peopl deal with mental health and addict problem I probabl have more peopl talk to me about mental health and addict than nearli anyth els you know folk talk about the economi they talk about educ but when it get realli person you know Im in a coffe shop or talk to folk on a line here and somebodi take my hand and pull me closer what they talk to me about is mental health and addict and shame on us if we dont do more to help peopl who are suffer and famili who are in pain becaus of that and we are go to have a nation secur and foreign polici that america can be proud of We are go to lead the world in accord with our valu in pursuanc of our interest and further of our secur along with our friend and alli It just absolut bewild me when I hear donald trump tri to talk about nation secur it not just as joe biden said it not just he doesnt know what he talk about that bad enough but what he often say hurt us It send the wrong messag to friend and foe alik in the world and we are live in a complex world one where we need steadi where weve got to have a real sens of how were go to get where we want to go to help as mani peopl to keep our countri safe but to do it with the kind of big the kind of confid that realli mark america at our best you know sometim when I hear trump talk about how we should all be so afraid all the time and then I find a few minut to watch the olymp I think my good you

thi high school and what it repres for the student here and whi is that so import for those of us who are no longer in high school becaus weve got to get the economi work for everybodi not just those

infrastructur bank so that we have public and privat fund work togeth so we dont just wait on congress to act but we are build rebuild maintain all the time and it not just what we can see as import as that is We need a new modern electr grid that can take and distribut clean renew energi across america and we need to final finish the job of connect everi home and busi everywher in america from inner citi to remot rural area to highspe broadband access so they can be a part of the 21st centuri digit economi you know I wa talk to a group of my friend who are teacher I love teacher thank you

your imagin creat new dream I met young peopl I said well what got you interest in comput design 3D design robot well they were interest in the art they were interest in what they could do to design and make thing So the answer wa 70 percent of teacher but here the problem 5 million student  5 million home with student in them in america do not have access to the internet and so were alreadi creat a big gap  a homework gap which turn into an achiev gap and doesnt give everi kid the chanc to go as far as hi or her hard work and talent will take them So when I talk about infrastructur Im

a factori worker and the daughter of a small businessman and stand here befor you and so when I think about how hard my dad work and I think about him print those fabric and then load them into hi car and deliv them to whoever order them and then expect to be paid becaus he had done the work it just realli hit me person when peopl are stand up and tell their stori they were smallbusi peopl they were plumber electrician painter who did work for donald trump and he refus to pay them that violat the basic bargain If you do your job your suppos to be reward for your work not stif not told to go sue somebodi and I cant help but take it person becaus I think about what would have happen to my famili if my father had taken a job like that and put hi heart and soul into it bought the materi bought the paint did the labor show up deliv the product and is told were not pay you but person after person small busi after small busi is tell the same stori that they were not paid they were told to go sue donald trump now your a small busi you cant afford lawyer to go sue somebodi that not the way it suppos to work So when I talk about creat new job in infrastructur advanc manufactur clean renew energi I also talk about creat more small busi and small busi that will actual grow and give more peopl a chanc to fulfil their dream and will be part of the basic bargain who will be paid for the work that they do so they can stay in busi now I got to tell you creat the job of the futur mean weve got to make sure that all american not just young american have all the educ and all the skill that are need that whi I want to start with earli childhood educ so that more young kid get prepar to succeed in school I want to see more technic educ like I saw right here in john marshal across america so that high school student can be better prepar you know when we stop do vocat educ some year ago we basic sent a messag to so mani young peopl there onli one way to be success in america youv got to go to a four year colleg that is so unfair and it also untru actual if you look at job project more than half of the job that will be avail in america in 2020 will not requir a fouryear colleg degre and so how are we go to get our peopl prepar were go to bring more technic educ not the old fashion kind but what I saw here at john marshal were go to bring comput code like I saw in a classroom just a few minut ago were go to bring engin and design work were go to give young kid in high school the chanc to either get that educ right in their own school or go to a commun colleg that will provid it and give them credit to get them credenti an associ degre or credit to go on to a four year colleg So were go to be more on apprenticeship program I want everybodi who will to work to be prepar I dont want ani excus Im a kind of no excus person If you are will to do the work I want to make sure weve got an economi that will produc the job and then I want to make fouryear colleg afford If you go to a fouryear public colleg or univers it should be afford and were go to make commun colleg free for everybodi that want to go to commun colleg and were go help everybodi with student debt pay down the debt get it off their back now I think  I think it fair to say OK how are you go to do all that that fair to ask well were go to do it in two way number one we are go to tax the wealthi who have made all of the incom gain in the last 15 year the super wealthi corpor wall street theyr go to have to invest in educ in skill train in infrastructur becaus we have to grow thi economi We do need to have the resourc to do that and ive laid out what I want to do and how I would do it close the loophol creat a fairer tax system but ive made veri clear Im the onli candid who ran in either of the democrat or the republican primari who said from the veri begin I will not rais tax on the middl class the middl class ha to catch up to they were befor the great recess and so ive laid thi all out and so independ analyst economist and other are look at what ive said and what donald trump ha said and in fact accord to an independ analysi by moodi analyt carri out by the man who wa john mccain econom advis  if you were to implement what I am propos we would creat at least 10 million new job in the first term of my administr By contrast if you look at what trump is propos and how he want to give huge tax break to peopl who are wealthi like him it would cost our economi 34 million job now thi is not me say it thi is an independ analysi say it that ha tri to look at thi veri object but what doe that mean for ohio If we divid across the countri by popul ohio would gain 376000 job under my plan and lose more than 123000 job under donald trump plan and it hard  it not hard to see whi becaus he want to give tax cut to big corpor millionair wall street money manag he even creat a new tax loophol that we call the trump loophol becaus it realli good for trump It would let millionair and billionair cut their tax rate in half on a lot of their incom under hi plan donald trump would pay a lower tax rate than middleclass famili Of cours we have no idea what tax rate he pay becaus unlik everybodi els who run for presid in the last four or five decad he refus to releas hi tax return so the american peopl cant realli judg and then there the estat tax which he want to elimin altogeth So if you believ donald trump is as wealthi as he claim  we cant say that for sure but let assum it  he would  by elimin the estat tax  save the trump famili 4 billion and do absolut noth for 998 percent of all american now think about what we could do with 4 billion in ohio We could build 280 new elementari school We could elimin the outstand student loan of 166000 ohioan We could provid health care to 370000 veteran and we could sure rebuild everi crumbl bridg in thi state and fix a lot of the highway that are caus folk to incur expens donald trump doesnt need a tax cut I dont need a tax cut it time for the wealthiest american whoever you are as well as corpor and wall street to pay your fair share in tax you have been success in thi countri becaus of everyth thi countri repres were go to stop give tax break to corpor that out sourc job and profit were go to reward those who invest in their employe again If corpor move their headquart oversea were go to slap an exit tax on them and tri to persuad them not to move were go to add a new tax on multimillionair crack down on tax game and close loophol and then use that money to make the kind of invest that will grow the economi for everybodi So here  here the bottom line there are just 83 day left in thi elect I keep track of them cross them off and for anyon wait for donald trump to suddenli becom more respons  rememb what a great american maya angel said when someon show you who they are believ them and I  I think it fair to say that donald trump ha shown us who he is he can hire and fire anybodi he want from hi campaign they can make him read new word from a teleprompt but he is still the same man who insult gold star famili demean women mock peopl with disabl and think he know more about isi than our gener there is no new donald trump thi is it and you know I hope you will talk to ani of your friend who are flirt with the idea of vote for donald trump friend dont let friend vote for trump So now  now here what I have to ask all of you Im proud that we have run a campaign of issu not insult that what Im go to continu to do for the next 83 day becaus I think the detail actual matter that whi I sweat the detail you know I  I realli care a lot about what happen to the young peopl and the famili and our senior that whi Im go to do everyth I can to rais the nation minimum wage so that it is a live wage Im go to do everyth I can to make sure that you have the health care you need at an afford price and get the cost of prescript drug down becaus they are onc again get out of reach I wa at an event the other day and a veri distinguish doctor the head of a big hospit in new york he said weve got to do someth about prescript drug cost thi is not a  not a patient or a famili thi is one of the most distinguish doctor in new york citi He said it get to the point where I cant prescrib certain drug that my patient need becaus the insur wont pay for them medicar medicaid  nobodi will pay for them becaus they are too expens and he mention particularli a drug by gilead that will cure hepat C and it is so expens that a lot of american are be left out and you know what realli is upset about thi Is that drug compani sell that same drug all over the world at a much lower price to everybodi els now Im proud  Im proud that our drug compani invent drug to cure realli terribl diseas and treat chronic diseas Im proud of that but let be clear your tax dollar help support the research that is use to creat those drug in the first place your tax dollar support the food and drug administr that test those drug to determin whether or not they are safe and effect to be abl to go to market and then we end up in america pay the highest price for those drug that we have help to creat We have got to take thi on and we can do it without hurt research and discoveri and new drug and new devic and there are two other issu that I want to mention respect health becaus ive been on the campaign trail now for  well about a year and a half ever sinc april of 2015 So I have talk with and mostli listen to thousand of american now peopl talk to me about their job they talk to me about educ they talk to me about student loan and the high cost of colleg they talk to me a lot about gun violenc they talk to me a lot about the thing that are on their mind but the most emot encount I have are when famili grab my hand and talk to me about mental health and addit We have got to do a better job We have too mani famili and too mani individu american whose live are be either total undermin or shorten becaus of mental health and becaus of addict So Im go to work on those thing too as your presid becaus weve got to tackl these two problem and I also want to defend the right that american now

dream it you should be abl to build it and so well be talk a lot more about small busi and about our econom plan in the day and week ahead but today here in thi commun colleg devot to open mind and creat a great understand of the world in which we live I want to address someth that I am hear about from american all over our countri everywher I go peopl tell me how concern they are by the divis rhetor come from my oppon in thi elect and I I understand that concern becaus it like noth weve heard befor from a nomine for presid of the unit state from one of our two major parti from the start donald trump ha built hi campaign on prejudic and paranoia He is take hate group mainstream and help a radic fring take over the republican parti hi disregard for the valu that make our countri great is profoundli danger In just thi past week under the guis of outreach to africanamerican trump ha stood up in front of larg white audienc and describ black commun in such insult and ignor term poverti reject horribl educ no hous no home no ownership crime at level nobodi ha seen right now he said you can walk down the street and get shot those are hi word but when I hear them I think to myself how sad donald trump miss so much He doesnt see the success of black leader in everi field the vibranc of blackown busi the strength of the black church He doesnt see  He doesnt see the excel of histor black colleg and univers or the pride of black parent watch their children thrive He appar didnt see polic chief brown of dalla on televis after the murder of five of hi offic conduct himself with such digniti He certainli doesnt have ani solut to take on the realiti of system racism and creat more equiti and opportun in commun of color and for everi american It realli doe take a lot of nerv to ask peopl he ignor and mistreat for decad what do you have to lose becaus the answer is everyth now trump lack of knowledg or experi or solut would be bad enough but what he do here is more sinist trump is reinforc harm stereotyp and offer a dog whistl to hi most hate support it a disturb preview of what kind of presid hed be and that what I want to make clear today A man with a long histori of racial discrimin who traffic in dark conspiraci theori drawn from the page of supermarket tabloid and the far dark reach of the internet should never run our govern our command our militari ask yourself if he doesnt respect all american how can he serv all american now I  I know that some peopl still want to give trump the benefit of the doubt they hope that he will eventu reinvent himself that there a kinder gentler more respons donald trump wait in the wing somewher becaus after all it is hard to believ anyon let alon a nomine for presid could realli believ all the thing he say but here the hard truth there is no other donald trump thi is it and maya angel a great american whom I admir veri much she onc said when someon show you who they are believ them the first time well throughout hi career and thi campaign donald trump ha shown us exactli who it who he is and I think we should believ him when he wa get hi start in busi he wa su by the justic depart for refus to rent apart to black and latino tenant their applic would be mark with a C C for color and then reject three year later the justic depart took trump back to court becaus he hadnt chang and the pattern continu through the decad state regul fine one of trump casino for repeatedli remov black dealer from the floor No wonder the turnov rate for hi minor employe wa way abov averag and let not forget that trump first gain polit promin lead the charg for the socal birther He promot the racist lie that presid obama is not realli an american citizen part of a sustain effort to delegitim america first black presid and in 2015 trump launch hi own campaign for presid with anoth racist lie He describ mexican immigr as rapist and crimin and he accus the mexican govern of activ send them across the border none of that is true and oh by the way  by the way mexico not pay for hi wall either If he ever tri to get it built the american taxpay will pay for it well be stuck with the bill but there ha been a steadi stream of bigotri come from him I think we all rememb when trump said a distinguish feder judg born in indiana could not be trust to do hi job becaus quot he a mexican think about that the man who today is the standard bearer of the republican parti said a feder judg who by the way had a distinguish record as a US attorney had to go in hide becaus mexican drug gang were after him who ha mexican heritag but just like me wa born in thi countri is somehow incap sole becaus of hi heritag even the republican speaker of the hous of repres paul ryan describ that and I quot as the textbook definit of a racist comment and to thi day  to thi day trump ha never apolog to judg curiel but for trump that is just par for the cours thi is someon who retweet white supremacist onlin like the user who goe by the name white genocid TM trump took thi fring bigot with a few dozen follow and spread hi messag to 11 million peopl hi campaign famous post an antisemit imag a star of david impos over a sea of dollar bill that first appear on white supremacist websit the trump campaign ha also select a promin white nation  nationalist leader as a deleg in california and they onli drop him under pressur when ask in a nation televis interview whether he would disavow the support of david duke a former grand wizard of the Ku klux klan trump wouldnt do it and onli later again under mount pressur did he backtrack and when trump wa ask about anti semit slur and death threat come from hi support he refus to condemn them through it all he ha continu push discredit conspiraci theori with racist underton you rememb he said that thousand of american muslim in new jersey cheer the 911 attack they didnt He suggest the senat ted cruz father wa involv in the kennedi assassin now perhap in trump mind becaus Mr cruz wa a cuban immigr he must have had someth to do with it and there is absolut of cours no evid of that just recent trump claim that presid obama found isi and he ha repeat that over and over again hi latest paranoid fever dream is about my health and all I can say is donald dream on but  but my friend   but my friend thi is what happen when you treat the nation enquir like gospel they said in octob Id be dead in six month it also what happen when you listen to the radio host alex jone who claim that 911 and the oklahoma citi bomb were insid job He even said and thi realli just is so disgust he even said the victim of the sandi hook massacr were child actor and no one wa actual kill there I dont know what happen in somebodi mind or how dark their heart must be to say thing like but trump doesnt challeng these lie he actual went on jone show and said your reput is amaz I will not let you down thi from the man who want to be presid of the unit state you know ive stood by presid obama side as he made the toughest decis a commanderinchief ha to make In time of crisi our countri depend on steadi leadership clear think calm judgment becaus one wrong move can mean the differ between life and death I know we have veteran here and I know we have famili mother and spous and children of peopl current serv the last thing we need in the situat room is a loos cannon who cant tell the differ  or doesnt care to  between fact and fiction and who buy so easili into racial ting rumor someon so detach from realiti should never be in charg of make decis that are as real as they come and that is yet anoth reason whi donald trump is simpli temperament unfit to be presid of the unti state now I  I hear and I read some peopl who are say well that  hi bluster and is bigotri is  is just overh campaign rhetor An outrag person say outrag thing for attent but look at hi polici the one that trump ha propos  they would put prejudic into practic and dont be distract by hi latest effort to muddi the water He may have some new peopl put new word in hi mouth but we know where he stand He would form a deport forc to round up million of immigr and kick them out of the countri hed abolish the bed rock constitut principl that say if your born in the unit state your an american citizen He say that children born to undocu parent in america are anchor babi and should be deport million of them hed ban muslim around the world from enter our countri just becaus of their religion now think about that for a minut how would that actual work the peopl land in US airport would line up to get their passport stamp  just like they do now but in trump america when they step up to the counter the immigr offic would ask everi singl person what is your religion and then what what is someon say Im a christian but the agent doesnt believ him Do they have to prove it how would they do that realli ever sinc the pilgrim land on plymouth rock america ha distinguish itself as a haven for peopl flee religi persecut believ in religi freedom and religi liberti under donald trump america would distinguish itself as the onli countri in the world to impos a religi test at the border now come to think of it there actual mayb one other place that doe that the so call islam state the territori that isi control what a cruel ironi that someon run for presid would equat us with them now but dont worri some will say as presid trump will be surround by smart advisor who will rein in hi worst impuls So when a tweet get under hi skin and he want to retali with a cruis missil mayb cooler head will convinc him not to well mayb but look at who he put in charg of hi campaign trump like to say he onli hire the best peopl but he had to fire so mani campaign manag it like an episod from the apprentic and the latest shake up wa design to quot let trump be trump So to do that he hire stephen bannon the head of a right wing websit call breitbartcom as the campaign ceo now to give you a flavor of hi work here are a few headlin that theyv publish and Im not make thi up birth control make women unattract and crazi would you rather your child had femin or cancer gabbi gifford the gun control movement human shield hoist it high and proud the confeder flag proclaim a gloriou heritag and that one came shortli after the charleston massacr when democrat and republican alik were do everyth they could to heal racial divid that breitbart and bannon tri to inflam just imagin donald trump read that and think thi is what I need more of in my campaign now bannon ha nasti thing to say about pretti much everyon thi spring he rail against speaker paul ryan for quot rub hi socialjustic catholic in my nose everi second No wonder he gone to work for trump the onli presidenti candid ever to get into a public feud with the pope it truli hard to believ but accord to the southern poverti law center which track hate group breitbart embrac idea on the extremist fring of the conserv right thi is not conservat as we have known it thi is not republican as we have known it these are racist idea racebait idea antimuslim anti immigr antiwoman all key tenant make up an emerg racist ideolog known as the altright now altright is short for alternativeright the wall street journal describ it as a loos but organ movement mostli onlin that reject mainstream conservat promot nation and view immigr and multicultur as threat to white ident So the de facto merger between breitbart and the trump campaign repres a landmark achiev for thi group a fring element ha effect taken over the republican parti and thi is part of a broader stori  the rise tide of hardlin rightw nation around the world just yesterday one of britain most promin rightw leader nigel farag who stoke antiimmigr sentiment to win the referendum to have britain leav the european union campaign with donald trump in mississippi  farag ha call for a bar on the children of legal immigr from public school and health servic He ha said women are  and I quot  worth less than men and he support scrap law that prevent employ from discrimin base on race that who donald trump want by hi side when he is address an audienc of american voter and the grandgodfath of thi global brand of extrem nation is russian presid vladimir putin In fact farag ha appear regularli on russian propaganda program now he stand on the same stage as the republican nomine trump himself heap prais on putin and embrac prorussian polici He talk casual of abandon our nato alli recogn russia annex of crimea give the kremlin a free hand in eastern europ american presid from truman to reagan to bush to clinton to obama have reject the kind of approach trump is take on russia and we should too all of thi add up to someth weve never seen befor Of cours there alway been a paranoid fring in our polit a lot of it aris racial resent but it never had the nomine of a major parti stoke it encourag it and give it a nation megaphon until now On david duke radio show the other day the mood wa jubil We appear to have taken over the republican parti one white supremacist said duke laugh No there still more work to do he repli So no one should have ani illus about what realli go on here the name may have chang racist now call themselv racialist white supremacist now call themselv white nationalist the paranoid fring now call itself altright but the hate burn just as bright now trump is tri to rebrand himself as well but dont be fool there an old mexican proverb that say tell me with whom you walk and I will tell you who you are So we know who trump is A few word on a teleprompt wont chang that He say he want to make america great again but more and more it seem as though hi real messag seem to be make america hate again and thi isnt just about one elect it about who we are as a nation it about the kind of exampl we want to set for our children and our grandchildren next time you see trump on TV think about all the children listen across america kid hear a lot more than we think parent and teacher are alreadi worri about what they call the trump effect they report that bulli and harass are on the rise in our school especi target student of color muslim and immigr At a recent high school basketbal game in indiana white student held up trump sign and taunt latino player on the oppos team with chant of build the wall and speak english after a similar incid in iowa one frustrat school princip said they see it in a presidenti campaign and now it OK for everyon to say thi We wouldnt toler thi kind of behavior befor and we wouldnt toler it in our home and we should not stand for it from a presidenti candid My friend thi is a moment of reckon for everi republican dismay that the parti of lincoln ha becom the parti of trump it a moment of reckon for all of us who love our countri and believ that america is better than thi twenti year ago when bob dole accept the republican nomin he point to the exit in the convent hall and told ani racist in the parti to get out the week after 911 georg W bush went to a mosqu and declar for everyon to hear that muslim love america just as much as I do In 2008 john mccain told hi own support that they were wrong about the man he wa tri to defeat senat mccain made sure they knew barrack obama he said wa an american citizen and a decent person We need that kind of leadership again We can have our disagr and believ me I understand that I think that healthi We need good debat but we need to do it in a respect way not fingerpoint and blame and stir up

elect I will be a presid for democrat republican independ for peopl who vote for me for peopl who dont for all american that is what I think we need We need to unifi our countri and go forward into the futur with confid and optim today I want you to know a littl bit about where I stand and how I see the world and america place in it I spent four year as your secretari of state eight year befor that as senat from the great state of new york six year on the senat arm servic committe If there one core belief that ha guid and inspir me everi step of the way it is thi the unit state is an except nation I believ we are still lincoln last best hope of earth were still reagan shine citi on a hill were still robert kennedi great unselfish compassion countri and it not just that we have the greatest militari or that our economi is larger than ani on earth it also the strength of our valu the strength of the american peopl everyon who work harder dream bigger and never ever stop tri to make our countri and the world a better place and part of what make america an except nation is that we are also an indispens nation In fact we are the indispens nation peopl all over the world look to us and follow our lead My friend we are so lucki to be american It is an extraordinari bless it whi so mani peopl from so mani place want to be american too but it also a seriou respons the decis we make and the action we take even the action we dont take affect million even billion of live you know that youv seen it now all of thi may seem evid especi to men and women who have worn the uniform you may wonder how anyon could disagre but in fact my oppon in thi race ha said veri clearli that he think american exception is insult to the rest of the world In fact when vladimir putin of all peopl critic american exception my oppon agre with him say and I quot if your in russia you dont want to hear that america is except well mayb you dont want to hear it but that doesnt mean it not true My oppon miss someth import when we say america is except it doesnt mean that peopl from other place dont feel deep nation pride just like we do It mean that we recogn america uniqu and unparallel abil to be a forc for peac and progress a champion for freedom and opportun our power come with a respons to lead humbl thought and with a fierc commit to our valu becaus when america fail to lead we leav a vacuum that either caus chao or other countri or network rush in to fill the void So no matter how hard it get no matter how great the challeng america must lead the question is how we lead what kind of idea strategi and tactic we bring to our leadership american leadership mean stand with our alli becaus our network of alli is part of what make us except No other countri in the world ha allianc like our russia and china have noth close We stand with our alli becaus gener of american troop fought and die to secur those bond and becaus they deliv for us everi day our alli share intellig on terrorist they provid stage area for our militari so we can respond quickli to event on the other side of the world other nation soldier sailor airmen and marin often fight side by side with our some of you may have serv and fought alongsid men and women from other countri you say them in action you know how import these bond are to our secur threaten to walk away from our allianc ignor the import that they still are to us is not onli wrong it danger If Im  if Im your presid our friend will alway know america will have your back and we expect you to have our american leadership mean bring the world togeth to solv global problem as onli we can the unit state built the intern coalit against isi now were work with partner to take back territori and defeat them without get drawn in to a ground war We brought the world togeth to impos sanction on iran and secur a deal that put a lid on iran nuclear program without fire a singl shot you dont build a coalit by insult our friend or act like a loos cannon you do it by put in the slow hard work of build relationship get countri work togeth wa my job everi day as your secretari of state it more than a photo op It take consist and reliabl actual it just like build person relationship peopl have to get to know that they can count on you that you wont say one thing one day and someth total differ the next and it certainli take more than tri to make up for a year of insult and insinu by drop in on our neighbor for a few hour and then fli home again that is not how it work american leadership mean lead with our valu in pursuanc of our interest in protect of our secur At our best the unit state is the global forc for freedom justic and human digniti We celebr our divers As a sourc of nation strength just look at our arm forc which repres all race religion ethnic and ye immigr from other countri all fight for the red white and blue We stand up to regim that abus human right We stand up for religi and ethnic minor for women for peopl with disabl and we comport ourselv with honor there no better proof of that than what our navi seal did dure the raid to kill osama bin laden I wa deepli honor to be part of that small group advis the presid I brought to those discuss my experi as a senat from new york on 911 and my commit to do whatev I could in whatev role I had to bring bin laden to justic youv all seen the pictur of us crowd into the smaller situat room watch the video screen everi second count one of the copter misgaug how high the wall wa around the courtyard clip the tail get disabl It didnt stop the seal from rush out get into the compound return fire against bin laden bodi guard take on hi adult son and final bin laden himself but the seal knew that they had to destroy the helicopt befor they left I wa hold my breath through the entir oper becaus at anytim pakistani soldier could have arriv thi compound wa in a militari garrison citi actual the home of their militari academi So ye everi second count but still our seal took the time to move the women and children bin laden famili member to safeti befor destroy the helicopt that is what honor look like that is america at our best mayb the soldier of other nation wouldnt have bother or mayb theyd have taken reveng on those famili member of terrorist but that is not who we are and anyon who doesnt understand that doesnt understand what make our nation great and let me say someth els about american great there no question we face real threat and real enemi that we need to confront and defeat but my oppon is wrong when he say america is no longer great consid the record of the past either year In 2009 our global economi wa collaps osama bin laden wa plot we had more than 180000 troop fight two war iran wa race toward a nuclear weapon mani of our alli were less support of american leadership than they had been in decad look where we are now We have pull the global economi out of freefal thank to the hard work and sacrific of the american peopl We have redeploy well over 100000 troop from iraq and afghanistan so they can go home rest and train for futur conting We cut off iran path to a nuclear weapon We convinc russia to reduc their nuclear weapon arsen We protect our alli israel and we brought osama bin laden to justic We did that We american did all of that work togeth across parti line and there is no question we have more work to do but let be clear  we are stronger togeth and it will be my goal if I am fortun enough to be your presid to bring peopl back togeth again to set our goal and move forward to achiev them I know that we cant cozi up to dictat We have to stand up to them We cant contain isi we must defeat them and we will We will do whatev is necessari for as long as it take to bring them to justic and end their reign of terror onc and for all thi elect is about how to make thing better now make no mistak I believ we do have better day ahead but thing could also get wors If more countri get nuclear weapon if we abandon our alli if our commanderinchief order our militari to break the law and commit tortur or murder terrorist famili member that is whi it is so critic we get thi right and let me underscor what I have said throughout thi campaign we must onli send our troop into harm way as a last resort not a first choic that must be our bedrock principl but we must be abl to act decis on our own when we need to I complet reject anyon includ my oppon who call the american militari and I quot a disast that is an insult to the men and women serv today and all who have serv befor who put their live on the line it just not true We do have more work to do to continu to have the strongest most effect militari in the world I know thi is someth that matter a great deal to everyon in thi room and here is what we have to do We cannot lose our militari edg and that mean give the pentagon the stabl predict fund it need to make smart invest youv heard of a sequest the arbitrari cap that congress ha impos on our entir govern for the past sever year look I am all for cut the fat out of the budget and make sure we stretch our dollar I am proud of the fact that when my husband left offic we had a balanc budget and a surplu and I hope that someday we can get back to do that but we cannot impos arbitrari limit on someth as import as our militari that make no sens at all the sequest make our countri less secur let end it and get a budget deal that support america militari our famili and our countri and let make reform a prioriti so that the defens depart spend it budget on the right thing and by the way the last thing we need is a presid who bring more namecal and temper tantrum to washington weve got to get peopl listen to each other again get both parti actual to work togeth let modern our armi and marin our navi and air forc our coast guard We need to respond to evolv threat from state like russia china iran and north korea from network crimin and terrorist network like isi We need a militari that is readi and agil so it can meet the full rang of threat and oper on short notic across everi domain not just land sea air and space but also cyberspac well invest in new technolog so new breakthrough can transform our militari just as stealth precis weapon and advanc commun did in the past well make a renew push to reduc the world nuclear weapon becaus that doe make us all safer and well step up our effort to secur nuclear materi around the world and stop terrorist from acquir or use weapon of mass destruct one of the first thing I will do as presid is to call for a new nuclear postur review We have to make sure that america arsen is prepar to meet futur threat well invest in the next frontier of militari engag protect US interest in outer space and cyberspac youv seen report russia hack into a lot of thing china hack into a lot of thing russia even hack into the democrat nation committe mayb even some state elect system So weve got to step up our game make sure we are well defend and abl to take the fight to those who go after us As presid I will make it clear that the unit state will treat cyber attack just like ani other attack We will be readi with seriou polit econom and militari respons and were go to invest in protect our government network and our nation infrastructur I want us to lead the world in set the rule of cyberspac If america doesnt other will So in short we have to be readi to win today fight and tomorrow but you know that the most import thing isnt the size of our militari or the sophist of our weapon the most import thing is our peopl the men and women who put on the uniform and serv We need to We need to take a hard look at our militari personnel polici to make sure we are do everyth to attract and keep the best and the brightest who volunt We need to support not onli them but also their famili and as presid I will never forget the debt we owe to our veteran and your famili who also serv I will never ever disrespect gold star famili whove made the ultim sacrific for our nation Or prison of war who endur so much in our name To insult them is just so wrong and it say a lot about the person do the insult In the senat I work with republican to increas the benefit paid to gold star famili to expand access to militari health insur to make sure all member of the guard and reserv and their famili have access to health benefit whether theyr deploy or train at home I fought success to amend the 2007 defens appropri act To establish a train program for famili

to suicid that whi just two day ago when I releas my plan to improv mental health servic for all american I includ a specif section about more help for veteran and their famili becaus we know too mani arent get the help they need right now weve got to serv them just as they serv us We are also go to help more veteran look for job with expand tax credit for busi that hire veteran more support to veteran who want to start their own busi and make it easier for veteran to get credit for the skill they learn while serv and we will crack down on forprofit school and compani that prey on or discrimin against servic member veteran or militari famili they should be asham of themselv and were go to hold them account We will also work close with the american legion to clean up and expedit the appeal process benefit should be deliv as quickli as possibl and appeal should be decid as expediti as possibl I thank you for the work you are do on that now a lot of what I have mention ha support from democrat and republican maintain our militari and care for our veteran should never be a partisan issu defend american exception should alway be abov polit but thi is not a normal elect the debat are not the normal disagr between republican and democrat So I hope you will listen care to what my oppon and I propos consid our plan and the valu behind them and after youv given us both a fair hear I hope you will join the grow number of american democrat republican and independ who are support our vision for the kind of futur that we want for our countri thi elect shouldnt be about ideolog it not just about differ over polici It truli is about who ha the experi and the tempera to serv as presid and commanderinchief just three week ago 50 republican nation secur expert who serv

other great member of congress tim ryan and joyc beatti and your mayor thank to mayor jackson and I hope  I hope that ohio will send ted strickland to the senat now behind me are some of the great labor leader of our countri  randi weingarten  lee saunder  rich trumka Im proud to be on the same stage with them becaus theyr alway fight for work famili now onc I get over my allerg reaction  let me say that we are here in part becaus we know how import thi elect is to ohio it not just as tim said  that ohio is one of the battleground state you hear about everi four year it that ohio repres everyth that great about america and all of the challeng and the opportun that we face that whi thi elect is critic to everi person in thi state and what I want to emphas is I know we cant face our problem alon We have to work togeth We believ we are stronger togeth and that is in stark contrast to donald trump rememb what he said at hi convent He said I alon can fix it now think about what that leav out my friend that leav out all of our troop on the front line It leav out our polic offic and firefight who run toward danger It leav out doctor and nurs who care for us It leav out teacher and educ who care for the most import peopl in our live our children It leav out everybodi except him and when he say I alon can fix it that clearli demonstr he doesnt understand how america work how we got great and whi we are great today and what we need to do togeth to face the futur becaus our campaign is about we will fix it togeth we will work togeth we will bring our countri togeth and what better exampl of that are our labor union they are built  on the principl of solidar they look out for each other they fight for fair wage and collect bargain for safe work condit just last week we learn onc again becaus anoth studi came out that confirm what we alreadi knew when more worker are in union wage are higher and not just for union member but for all worker that whi if tim and I are elect were go to say no to attack on union No to roll back collect bargain No to unfair trade deal like tpp No to pension cut that deni you the secur retir that youv earn No to right to work becaus right to work is wrong for worker and wrong for america but were not just about say no were go to say ye to stand up for worker right and digniti ye to good job and benefit ye to the american dream It is big enough for everyon to share the promis and so that whi dure thi campaign I have been run a campaign base on issu not insult I believ anyon who ask for your vote should tell you what theyr go to do start tomorrow you can read about the plan tim and I have becaus were put out a book did somebodi have a copi of that book hey somebodi back there you got a copi of the book I can show the crowd were put out a book call stronger togeth that more than a slogan for the campaign that a guid principl for the futur we want to build and that exactli what were go to do now some peopl say wait a minut youv got so mani plan well your right I do have plan you know whi becaus I want you to know what I want to do to help you and what kind of result were go to work to achiev I have thi oldfashion idea that if your ask somebodi to vote for you they ought to tell you what they want to do and then hold you account when you get elect and ill tell you what our plan start with a veri simpl idea that were go to get the economi to work for everyon not just those at top were go to do it with the biggest invest in new job that weve had sinc world war II more infrastructur job advanc manufactur job clean renew energi job anyon will to work hard should have a job that can support them and their famili a job with digniti with onli a futur to be proud of not to worri about were also go to offer new solut for famili famili are differ today than they were in the 1950 for heaven sake so we need to make sure we help support famili the way they are today not way back when help peopl support and balanc famili and work with paid famili leav earn sick day afford childcar and final guarante equal pay for women work and here is our book it call strong togeth for a reason you can read about what we want to do on the economi and everyth els It will be avail start tomorrow becaus the choic for famili ha never been clearer just look at donald trump track record when it come to hardwork men and women I know Im allerg to it too but we have to look at hi record there are mani peopl you know who are think about vote for him and you know friend dont let friend vote for trump and here is what you can tell among mani thing he hire a unionbust firm to break up and organ campaign at hi hotel in la vega He built hi career on refus to pay worker plumber painter glass instal marbl instal peopl who did work for him and then he refus to pay them He stiff small busi like my dad My dad and tim dad had realli small busi that gave us a good middleclass life I am just so grate my father never got a contract from donald trump My dad work hard He print draperi fabric and I would go help him sometim there be a long tabl in hi print plant and the fabric would be roll out and then the silk screen would be laid down and then you pour the paint in then you take the squeege you push it across the screen you lift it up you go all the way down and you go to the second tabl all the way back then when he finish hed load those draperi fabric into hi car and deliv them I dont know what would have happen to my famili if he had done a big job think it wa a good deal for trump and he get there and the trump peopl say were not go to pay you and then after harass mayb they say OK well pay you 30 cent on the dollar He ha driven hardwork peopl into bankruptci and taken six bankruptci himself now here in ohio you know veri much that a presid make decis that affect peopl live and livelihood when million of job were on the line in the auto industri presid obama made the right decis to save the auto industri I know weve got some uaw member here I wa proud to support them then Im even prouder now that the auto industri just had it best year ever think how differ thing could have turn out I know thi is hard to imagin if it had been donald trump in the oval offic last year  rememb thi last year he said it didnt matter whether or not we save the auto industri either way would have been accept He said we could have just let it go never mind the 850000 peopl in ohio and million more across the countri whose job and paycheck were tie to the auto industri now what els could we expect from someon whose most famou word are your fire thi is the kind of differ that thi elect realli pose peopl like tim and me who want to creat more good job with rise wage and benefit for everybodi will to work hard that the basic bargain of america and somebodi who stif peopl to bankruptci and laid off peopl one of hi bankruptci put 1000 peopl out of work everi time you hear him talk about how he know how to creat job just look at the fact educ yourself and your friend and your colleagu becaus the kind of bluster and wild claim that he make about everybodi and everyth dont stand up to ani scrutini the same is true when it come to whether we keep our countri safe stronger togeth mean work with our alli and our partner right were not just elect a presid were elect a commanderinchief So when donald trump say and I quot I know more about isi than the gener do when he claim as he ha that our arm forc are a disast or he insult a gold star famili that not just wrong and offens that danger our militari is a nation treasur and a presid must respect the men and women who risk their live and wear the uniform of our countri some of you know tim kain son is deploy right now he a marin tim and I will not onli respect our men and women in uniform we will protect them and we will ensur that they are given the resourc that they need to do the danger mission we ask them to do on our behalf last week we saw even more evid that trump is temperament unfit and total unqualifi to be presid In just a few hour he manag to turn hi trip to mexico into an embarrass intern incid He even got into a twitter war with the presid of mexico and then he deliv hi most hatefil hard hard line speech yet  doubl down on hi absurd plan to send a deport forc to roundup 16 million peopl to deport them now you cant make thi stuff up can you He can tri to distract with divis danger rhetor He could tri to fool voter into think somehow he not as harsh and inhuman as he seem but it too late when you see what he ha said and done in thi campaign when you see that he cant even go to a foreign countri without get into a public feud with the presid I think the answer is clear donald trump doe not have the tempera to be our commanderinchief imagin him in a real crisi ive said it befor and I believ it  a man you can bait with a tweet cannot be trust with nuclear weapon now look I know that these elect are alway tight and hard I am not take anybodi anywher for grant that whi were here today becaus we need your help We need to make sure we have an elect that valid the kind of posit futur that will make life better for the peopl of ohio and empti promis and rais to tax will do that It wont get your famili a job It wont keep our troop safe It wont heal the divid in america ive spent my life fight

against I dont care who you are if your will to work and do your part you should be abl to get ahead and stay ahead that is the basic bargain of america So if you look at thi book which I hope you will it stand in stark contrast to donald trump He say I alon can fix it now the folk I have met dure thi campaign and for mani year befor know that we have challeng know weve got to come togeth and believ we have to work togeth to fix what our problem are that my view I want us to bring peopl togeth just the way union do just the way peopl in commun do and here in the quad citi and across the countri we can see proof everi day that we have to come togeth to meet our challeng So Im go to continu to emphas that we want to be the unit in thi campaign We believ that america is alreadi great and that we can becom greater if we do our part when somebodi say I alon can fix it think of the peopl he leav out everybodi els leav out our troop on the front line leav out firefight and polic offic who run toward danger leav our teacher and educ who do they best to chang children live leav out everybodi els that is hi campaign in a nutshel and what weve got to do in the next 63 day is to present the vision of america we believ in So were go to continu to say were stronger togeth were go to work togeth were go to run a campaign of issu not insult and we are go to be absolut strong in our support for union becaus we know nobodi get through life alon union help build the largest middleclass in the histori of the world in our countri they fought for fair wage safe work condit theyv help so mani peopl get on that run to the middleclass and their kid like dick durbin go even higher So I am go to say no to a tax on union I am go to say no to roll back collect bargain I am go to say no to unfair trade deal like the tpp Im go to say no No to pension cut that deni you the secur retir that you have work for and Im go to say no to right to work it not right for worker and it is not

thi campaign on issu our most import  our most import goal is get the economi to work for everybodi there noth  noth more import and how do you do that By creat more job and what are some of the area that I think we can realli emphas infrastructur our road our bridg our tunnel our port our airport also what we cant see our water system our sewer system We also need a new electr grid a modern

have dialup We have place where kid cant do the homework assign their teacher give them becaus they dont have access to the internet that is so unfair think of all the job well creat when we finish that off and then let look at advanc manufactur I believ we can compet with anybodi if we put our mind to it and Im go to have a manufactur renaiss polici that will put peopl to work I  I am so proud that denni and lonni are here becaus theyv been do so much to realli creat the new industri and auto and what the ibew doe in so mani import area of our economi I want to be your partner and I think it especi import to recogn that when the chip were down and the auto industri wa on it back presid obama did the right thing He save the american auto industri I support him then and I support him just as strongli now the american auto industri just had the best year it had in a long time and that wa becaus of the teamwork and the partnership that we had between the compani between the union and becaus the presid of the unit state knew we had to save the auto industri donald trump basic said he didnt care didnt matter to him It just show you how he doesnt understand or care about the real job that put bread on the tabl and give peopl a sens of purpos and digniti well you wont have to look far to find me in the oval offic if Im fortun enough to be your presid and to do everyth I can everi singl day to creat more job to save job to bring job back from oversea and if you contrast that with trump hi track record  hi track record is just the opposit He actual hire a union bust firm

resort hi casino He stif them He stiff small busi like I said my dad wa a small businessman he print draperi fabric hed get an order hed buy the materi hed get the silk screen made I would go sometim

youd lift the screen up you go all the way down get on the next tabl all the way back took a lot of time took a lot of hard work when he finish hed load up the fabric in hi car and hed go deliv them I am so happi he never got a contract from donald trump I dont know what my famili wouldv done if my dad did busi with peopl like trump who ha told hundr and hundr of small busi he been su 4000 time for not pay the bill that he owe If my dad had been told sorri just kid were not pay you  thi is the man who want to be presid of the unit state thi is someon who doesnt even honor contract that what is so danger about thi elect what donald trump say what he say about the economi that he know how to creat job He had six bankruptci In one bankruptci alon 1000 peopl lost their job the number add up He talk about want to protect job in america but everyth he make he made oversea He could have made suit and tie and furnitur in the unit state but no he made it oversea He even hire worker from oversea and he tell peopl well he couldnt find american who want to work in the heat you cant make thi stuff up can you It is truli unbeliev but what even wors is what he say about foreign polici As bad as he is about our economi he ha insult our alli he ha made common caus with dictat he ha basic endors vladimir putin and hi polici when he say I know more about isi than the gener when he claim our arm forc are a disast or he insult a gold star famili that not just offens that danger and just today our intellig profession said there wa credibl evid for them to pursu an investig into russia effort to interfer with our elect hack the democrat nation committe and when putin wa ask about it didnt deni it In fact he said it wa probabl a good thing it happen and thi is the person that donald trump prais We saw even more evid last week that he is temperament unfit and total unqualifi to be presid In just a few hour he manag to turn hi trip to mexico into an embarrass intern incid I mean just look at what happen He got into a twitter war with  and whi becaus the presid of mexico said I told him in the meet we werent pay for that wall So not onli did trump mess up hi first intern engag he choke He couldnt even bring himself to tell the presid of mexico one of hi veri few polici demand I mean he went back to arizona and gave anoth hatefil speech about round up and deport 16 million peopl even some of hi own advis are have a hard time explain that away So he go to tri to distract and divid he go to hope that we dont pay attent to what he been say for 14 15 month and we just tune in now these last two month that he somehow soften hi posit that there a realli anoth donald trump out there well youv got to ask yourself if you cant even go to a friendli foreign countri without get into a fight can thi person even claim to have the tempera to be in the oval offic and deal with real urgent crise As ive said befor and ill say it again a man who can be provok by a tweet should not

student debt can be paid back whether our health care system work whether we lead the world with strength and steadi work with alli and partner to make sure that we move toward peac and prosper there is an excit bold agenda befor us but it cannot be done by ani one person It must be done by all of us and that is someth that donald trump doe not understand among the mani troubl thing that were said at hi convent  and honestli I sometim didnt recogn what countri they were talk about It wa so dire so dark so divis so danger but among the thing he said wa I alon can fix it think of who that leav out our men and women in uniform troop on the front line peopl like mari who put on the uniform of the air forc to serv our countri think about the polic and firefight who rush toward danger think about those brave polic offic and emerg respond in orlando when the puls nightclub wa attack think about all the teacher the educ the professor the staff who work to give young peopl a much better chanc in the race of life think about all the hard work peopl who cant build a hous by themselv cant erect one of donald trump skyscrap by themselv think of all the small busi that take a big chanc My dad wa a small busi man I know what a chanc it is He couldnt do it alon he need custom he need supplier he need worker american dont say I alon can fix it We say well fix it togeth just watch us nobodi  nobodi can solv problem better than we can and I want to be a presid for all american not some american democrat republican independ everi singl american I want to be a presid for those who vote for me and those who vote against me becaus I want to bring our countri togeth Im veri proud that tim kain and I are run a campaign of issu not insult becaus I believ anybodi who is ask for your vote for the most import job not just in the countri but in the world should tell you what they plan to do I do have thi  I guess it an old fashion idea If your go to ask peopl for their vote they ought to have some idea what theyr vote for and I dont think it enough to say oh ill tell you later I think it import to lay it out and to tell you how it go to be paid for and that whi start today and especi for young peopl but realli for everybodi we are put out a book it call stronger togeth and in it It show thi is more than a slogan for the campaign thi is a blueprint for america futur among the thing that we talk about is the core of our agenda As laid out in thi book it is build an economi that work for everyon not just those at the top were go to make the biggest invest in new job sinc world war II infrastructur job like those here at the port our road our bridg our tunnel our port our airport they need work and there are million of job to be done and in addit to what you can see what about our water system our sewer system We need a new modern electr grid to be abl to take in clean renew energi that can then move us toward that futur we see I have a plan to instal a half a billion solar panel by the end of my first term and enough clean energi to power everi home in america by the end of my second term and I want young peopl especi to be part of thi to be in scienc technolog engin manufactur creat thi futur that will determin the qualiti of your live and the competit of our economi We also have to finish extend broadband access to everi place in america right now 70 percent of our teacher say that they assign homework to their student start in elementari school they requir the kid to learn how to use the internet I think that great We want to have an internetsavvi popul but here the problem five million home where littl kid live where high school kid live dont have the internet what doe that mean that mean theyr alreadi behind it so unfair were go to make thi economi grow but were also go to make it fair were go to have more advanc manufactur job I think we made a mistak year ago when we elimin what use to be call vocat educ weve got to return technic educ to our high school our commun colleg there are right now more than a million job that can be fill by peopl who are machinist comput design tool and die maker but for whatev reason they havent been given the chanc to get that train and mayb theyv been told you know what the onli futur is to go to a great univers like usf well that is true for a lot of peopl but it not true for everybodi and we need to make the hard work that build america the kind of great work with respect and purpos that is go to attract a new gener that whi youll read what I want to do in here were go to tri to make commun colleg free were also go to have apprenticeship program Im go to give a tax credit to ani compani that is will to pay a young person while that young parent made it time for us to step up and build america futur and let make it fair while we do that that whi ive said were go to emphasi the import of small busi right now small busi are have a tough time in florida and across america get access to credit right and get the kind of regul and overlap expect and standard that dont realli make sens I want to make it clean and clear and I particularli want young peopl with an idea for a small busi to feel that they can do it So I have propos a moratorium for three year on student debt so you can actual get a busi off the ground get it start make your futur I also believ we should rais the nation minimum wage anybodi work full time should not be live in poverti and final let guarante equal pay for women work which will rais famili incom anyon who will to work hard should have enough money to rais a famili did anybodi of you watch ani of the democrat convent well I dont know if you saw these two young peopl 17year old from kansa young man young woman went to the same high school about to be senior get a summer job work in a pizza restaur in their home town theyr pretti excit I rememb when I had what I thought of as my first real job not babi sit not you know just kind of knock around but a real job where I had to actual show up someplac and get a paycheck that wa pretti excit So a young man young woman were at our convent here the stori they told they were talk togeth one day after work theyd known each other and the young woman said you know Im excit becaus I think Im actual go to be abl to save some money for colleg make 8 an hour and her friend the young man look at her and he goe Im make 815 an hour and the young woman said well you didnt have ani experi befor thi job do thi did you He said No you know I didnt He said well what do you think happen the young man said Oh it must be a mistak So they togeth and I give the young man a lot of credit  good guy right they go to tell the manag that there been a mistak theyr do exactli the same job he make 015 more an hour what happen the manag fire them both and you know what that legal If you find out about somebodi els salari even if your do exactli the same job you can be retali against includ be fire in most place So when I say let have equal pay and some peopl I see look quizzic at me they say well of cours youv got to have equal pay well yeah if your in the militari and the pay scale is set or your in the govern and it set or your under a union contract and it set but if your in the vast major of job in america you have no idea whether your be paid fairli So we can not let that continu that wrong in america If your do the job you deserv to get the pay and so how are we go to fund thi well ill tell you were go where the money is were go to the peopl whove made the money in the last 15 year were go to the top onetenth percent the millionair the billionair theyr go to have to start pay for support our militari support our educ system support our health care system there could not be a bigger contrast between what ive propos when it come to tax and what donald trump ha propos He actual ha propos give trillion  and I mean that with a T  trillion in tax cut to big corpor millionair billionair and wall street money manag that would not onli explod our nation debt it would lead to massiv cut in educ and health care and mani of hi propos would realli benefit hi own famili but do noth for the remain 99plu percent of american and in fact independ analyst have said thi theyv look at our plan  he doesnt have much in the way of plan but theyv look at what he ha said  and theyv conclud if we did what trump is recommend we would lose 35 million job in four year If we do what Im recommend we stand to gain over 10 million job in the next four year and among the thing that I want to do is make sure we have an educ system from earli childhood through adulthood and that mean I want univers prek I want to help more kid get a better start so that when they get to kindergarten and first grade theyr readi to learn I want to work with our teacher and educ I respect teacher and educ and I want to give them the support they need to do the job we ask and I want to support univers like thi one now here one of the reason whi fifti thousand student 40 percent on pell grant A lot of peopl would never have gotten an educ if it werent for the feder pell grant program right but here what most impress A lot of school have a lot of pell grant thi univers graduat all categori of student at the same rate If your a pell grant student a nonpel grant student if your white africanamerican latina a latino asian everybodi graduat at the same rate and whi that happen is becaus thi univers make a particular commit to everi student and move as quickli as possibl to help kid who mayb are first gener colleg student right I  you know ive got to tell you when I got to colleg  now my father went to colleg on a footbal scholarship I knew I wasnt go to colleg on a footbal scholarship My mother had a realli difficult childhood she never got to go to colleg So my dad couldnt realli tell me much about go to colleg becaus he basic paid  play footbal for four year and love it My mom couldnt tell me So when I got to colleg I felt so out of place I wa so nervou there use to be someth way back in the dark age call collect phone call where you would call collect which meant that your parent had to pay for it and you just wait to see whether theyd accept it So I call home and I said I cant  I cant do thi it too hard everybodi here is smarter than I am theyr better prepar than I am I want to come home and my father who didnt want me to go so far away to school anyway he said come home and my mother said No you have to stick it out and if you feel the same way at the end of the year then you can make a differ decis Of cours my mother wa right I love it within a month or two but I know what it feel like to show up and wonder can you make it are you good enough are you smart enough and thank good usf ha peopl wait to mentor and reassur and guid student everi singl colleg and univers need to have that and then weve got to make it afford so kid dont have to leav becaus they no longer have the fund that they need and I want to do more in my effort to make childcar afford No famili should have to pay more than 10 percent of your incom on childcar and right now you have a lot of state where it cost more for childcar than tuition at colleg and univers So Im go to do  I know youv got childcar here but as I told the presid I want to do more to help you to make sure everi student parent ha a safe place to bring their child while theyr studi and work and tri to get their educ and then were go to help everybodi with student debt how mani of you have student debt were go to help you pay it back and pay it off quickli were go to get the interest rate down were go to give you new way of pay it becaus right now we have too may peopl labor under student debt in a way that hold your own futur back So were go to lift that burden off of you and were also go to make sure you can get qualiti afford health care everi age you are everi place you are were go to get the cost down premium copay deduct and especi prescript drug cost and there are two other thing were go to take on becaus ive heard about thi all across america were go to take on help more peopl with mental health and addict problem get the help you need So Im excit about what we can do to creat an economi and educ and health care system that work and while we do it were go to be protect the right of american all american We have fought too hard we have come too far and that mean civil right and it mean women right and gay right and voter right and worker right and disabl right and you know I believ with all my heart becaus ive done thi work my entir life I wa look at the disabl sign there My first job out of law school wa with the children defens fund I did a lot of interest thing and one of them wa to gather evid about whi so mani kid with disabl were out of school there wa no requir that you went to school if you were blind deaf in a wheelchair and we chang the law the first nation in the world to do that and I am so proud of our countri So these right are not for somebodi els We all know somebodi We all know a woman We all know somebodi in a racial or ethnic minor We all know a worker or a voter We all know a gay person and we all know somebodi with a disabl these are our right and the kind of thing that youv been hear from donald trump demean defam group of american peopl who have everi right to be respect by someon who want to be presid of the unit state and he stand there and mock a report with a disabl and he call women pig and he call mexican immigr rapist and crimin and he demean muslim and attack a gold star famili whose son die in action in iraq that not who we are So ye we have a lot of plan but we also have valu my friend and were go to stand up for american valu our book also outlin how were go to keep our countri safe from all threat were go to work with our alli not insult them were go to stand up to our adversari not cozi up to them were go to have real plan not claim and secret plan thi novemb the american peopl have a big choic to make when it come to nation secur On the one hand we have donald trump who ha call the american militari a disast who disrespect our militari leader by say and I quot I know more about isi than the gener do hi compani  and listen to thi becaus I know there are a lot of veteran and a lot of you know activ duti peopl base here in tampa hi compani  trump compani have fire veteran becaus they had to take time off to fulfil their militari commit and we all saw him disparag the khan a gold star famili who lost their son in a car bomb explos in iraq as he ran toward it to prevent the loss of life of peopl in hi unit and save hundr of hi fellow soldier and when ask whi he would insult a gold star famili he suggest that hi sacrific are somehow compar to their becaus he said and again I quot were go to bolster our defens includ with an intellig surg to protect us and our alli We will do whatev is necessari for as long as it take to bring isi to justic and end their reign of terror onc and for all and I will tell you thi I am a veri patient person I dont quit I dont give up I dont blink thi sunday will be the 15th anniversari of the attack of 911 I wa a senat from new york I knew peopl who were kill I work with famili and the few survivor I work to get the health care need by

action and if we did what kind of action would it be a missil strike would it be a bomb would it be an attack by special forc and when it came time to go around the tabl these were all extrem experienc thought expert We all gave our opinion I wa one who said I thought it wa worth the risk and I wa and I wa in that small situat room on that day you all know the stori some of you read the book some of you have seen the movi but there one thing I want to tell you becaus it demonstr again what our valu are as american rememb donald trump ha said he would order american troop to tortur he

be abl to begin a convers with the american peopl and offer some of my thought about isi iran and how we reform the VA system to provid better care for our vet and Im honor that in the last 24 hour more retir gener and admir have decid to endors my campaign To focu more on these crucial challeng tomorrow Im conven a meet of bipartisan nation secur leader and expert includ former secretari of homeland secur michael chertoff and janet napolitano gener john allen former act director of the cia michael morel and former nato suprem alli command jame stavridi and other We will discuss how to intensifi our effort to defeat isi and keep our countri safe To that end I want to underscor someth that I mention last night We should make it a top prioriti to hunt down the leader of isi abu bakr albaghdadi and bring him to justic just as we did with osama bin laden As with that oper get albaghdadi will requir a focus effort driven at the highest level but I believ it will send a resound messag that nobodi direct or inspir attack against the unit state and get away with it let me be clear last night wa yet anoth test and donald trump fail yet again We saw more evid that he is temperament unfit and total unqualifi to be command in chief He trashtalk american gener say theyv been quot reduc to rubbl He suggest he would fire them and replac them with hi handpick gener He attack dozen of former flag offic by say that quot weve been lose for us for a long time that how he talk about distinguish men and women who have spent their live serv our countri sacrif for us that how he would act as command in chief meanwhil bizarr onc again he prais russia strongman vladimir putin even take the astonish step of suggest that he prefer the russian presid to our american presid now that is not just unpatriot and insult to the peopl of our countri as well as to our command in chief It is scari becaus it suggest he will let putin do whatev putin want to do and then make excus for him I wa just think about all of the presid that would just be look at one anoth in total astonish what would ronald reagan say about a republican nomine who attack america gener and heap prais on russia presid I think we know the answer and when ask how he would stop the spread of global terror trump answer wa simpli take the oil the unit state of america doe not invad other countri to plunder and pillag We dont send our brave men and women around the world to steal oil and that not even get into the absurd of what it would involv massiv infrastructur larg number of troop mani year on the ground Of cours trump hasnt thought through ani of that everi republican hold or seek offic in thi countri should be ask if they agre with donald trump about these statement now one thing you didnt hear from trump last night is ani plan to take on isi one of the biggest threat face our countri He say hi plan is still a secret but the truth is he simpli doesnt have one and that not onli danger It should be disqualifi So I have a veri differ vision for how we keep our countri safe and strong I respect the men and women who put their live on the line to serv america I will work with our alli to defeat isi and I will hold true to our countri most cherish valu you know even with all of the attent paid to the campaign we cannot forget how import thi decis is thi weekend is the 15th anniversari of 911 I will never forget the horror of that day but I will never forget either the victim and survivor and the brave first respond and emerg respond that I met with and serv and work for as senat from new york that what kept me work so hard in the senat on behalf of 911 famili that who I wa think of 10 year later in the white hous situat room with presid obama when the decis wa made to bring osama bin laden to justic that the kind of command in chief I will be someon who will bring us togeth in common purpos to keep our peopl safe and our countri strong well as ive said mani mani time ive alway thought thi wa go to be a close elect that whi weve been put organ in place gear up for these final week to mobil and turn out our voter that exactli what were go to do and I feel were in a strong posit but were not take anyplac anyon anyth for grant were go to keep work as hard as we can and hope pull out as mani voter who agre with me as we possibl can muster Hi jeff  well jeff  first of all ive said that befor ive said it on numer occas I believ it I think put a big conting of american ground troop on the ground in iraq and syria would not be in the best interest of the fight against isi and other terrorist group In fact I think it would fulfil one of their dearest wish which is to drag the unit state back into a ground war in that region howev ive been veri clear and I said thi again last night I support the air campaign I support special forc I support enabl I support surveil intellig and reconnaiss I will absolut be prepar to do whatev is necessari to support the arab and kurdish fighter on the ground to take out as much of the infrastructur of isi from the air to go after baghdadi as I said today with a veri focus commit to take him off the battlefield I think the approach ive outlin intensifi what we are do but also recogn that there is no in my opinion path forward to ground troop that would be in our interest well Im go to let all of you ponder that last question I think there will be a lot of phd these and popular journal write on that subject for year to come I dont take my advic and I dont take anyth serious that come from the rnc We were talk about seriou issu last night I know the differ between what we have to do to fix the VA what we have to do to take the fight to isi than just make polit happi talk and I had a veri short window of time in that event last night to convey the serious with which I would approach the issu that concern our countri donald trump chose to talk about hi deep admir and support for vladimir putin mayb he did it with a smile and I guess the rnc wouldv like that like the hat Is thi a new look Oh your bring it back went shop in your closet yeah I do a lot of that I think what he said wa total inappropri and undisciplin I would never comment on ani aspect of an intellig brief that I receiv that a veri fair question I  I have been somewhat hearten by the number of articl recent point out the quit dispar treatment of trump and hi campaign compar to our I dont understand the reason for it I find it frustrat but it just part of the landscap that we live in and we just keep forg ahead look I  I think thi is a realli import moment for everybodi in our countri as you have seen by the number of republican concern about trump come forward and say thi is not accept they are will to put their name out there peopl whove never endors a democrat peopl whove never endors befor becaus they are so concern about thi man and how total unqualifi he is to be presid and how total temperament unfit he is to be command in chief So I know that he say outrag thing on a you know pretti regular basi and I know that part of the coverag and I know that it may be difficult to feel that you know exactli how to respond to some of hi behavior but were on the brink of make a veri critic decis for our countri and if I were not the candid if I were not the nomine if I were just a concern citizen Id be out here do everyth I could to sound the alarm about someon like donald trump get anywher near the white hous and I will continu to do that well you could look on the map and find aleppo I love you andrea you are indefatig your my kind of woman ill tell you what look at thi OK I know Go ahead I mean the sympathi vote the whole thing I love it ye matt olsen right right right right No that not true well you know look I mean the republican are just in a terribl dilemma tri to support a total unqualifi nomine I have no sympathi for them it their nomine but I am not go to toler them continu to make mislead inaccur accus and put out misinform about me and here the latest exampl matt olsen the veri distinguish and effect former director of the nation counterterror center wa so disturb by what he ha seen come from the trump campaign that he wrote an articl that I guess came onlin in the last 48 hour pull from public sourc veri clear statement by isi leader essenti throw whatev support they have to donald trump they have as matt olsen point out said they hope that allah deliv america to trump they have said that they hope that he is the presid becaus it would give even more motiv to everi jihadi someon who ha insult muslim ha insult a gold star famili of an incred heroic captain khan someon who ha said he doesnt want to let muslim around the world even come to our countri that is a gift for isi and that is what matt olsen who know more about thi than the republican tri to somehow muddi the water veri clearli state that what I mean and look Im not ask for ani special treatment I  I know the road that Im on ive been on it for 25 year and I just get up everi day and keep move forward I love thi countri I will serv it with my entir heart mind and soul I will do everyth I can

reportedli advis tri to preach the gospel alway and if necessari use word the scriptur tell us that faith without word is dead the epistl of jame tell us we cannot just be hearer of the word we must be doer and I believ that with all my heart I am grate for the gift of person salvat and for the great oblig of the social gospel To use the gift of grace wise To reflect the love of god and follow the exampl of jesu christ to the greater good of god belov commun that what lead me to devot my life in the way I could to serv other especi children I went to work right out of law school for the great marian wright edelman the daughter of a baptist minist from bennettsvil south carolina and the founder of the children defens fund she sent me door to door in new bedford massachusett on behalf

and to alabama to expos the racism of segreg academi I went undercov to alabama all by myself mari just said well you just have to go do it and I did now it would have been easier and certainli more remun to follow mani of my law school classmat to a high power new york law firm but the call to servic root in my faith wa just too power for me it ha alway been about tri to live up to the respons describ by the prophet micah that we do justic love kind and walk humbl with our god humil is not someth you hear much about in polit is it but we should none of us is perfect St paul remind us we all see through a glass darkli and for now onli know in part it becaus of that becaus of the limit we all face that faith requir a leap the convict of thing unseen it becaus of our limit and imperfect that we must reach out beyond ourselv to god and to each other It isnt easi but ive learn to be grate not just for my bless but also for my fault and there are plenti ive made my share of mistak I dont know anyon who hasnt everyon here today ha stumbl on their own stoni path it grace that lift us up and grace that lead us home but it also our job to learn from our mistak To do all we can to do better next time and to stay grate to live by the disciplin of gratitud our christian faith is a journey that never end it a constant challeng to live up to our own hope and ideal to love and to forgiv other as we want to be love and forgiven ourselv you know as presid obama remind us seek high offic is by definit an act of audac and yet our greatest leader are often the most humbl becaus they recogn both the awesom respons of power and the frailti of human action ive sat in the situat room with presid obama weigh conflict advic and imperfect inform wrestl with the hardest choic a leader can make whether to send our young men and women into harm way know that some of them will never return there is noth more humbl than that noth that should drive you to your knee more than that that whi in thi time of both peril and promis we need a presid who understand that none of us ha all the answer and no one person can fix our problem alon A presid who understand we have to look out for each other and lift each other up not tear each other down that what we need to do togeth invest in our peopl believ in each other creat the job and the school and the opportun for young peopl so that they believ that we care about them send our children to school that reflect their promis not our neglect make sure everi child is given the health care he or she need whether it is for an ailment of the bodi or the mind stand readi to lift each other up when we fall as we will give those who have made mistak a second third chanc our faith is a faith of second and third and fourth and fifth chanc for those who genuin are seek redempt and we need a presid who understand the power role that faith and commun of faith have alway play in move our countri toward justic from the abolitionist of the 19th centuri to the civil right movement of the 20th centuri to the unfinish busi of today A presid who will pray with you and for you who will defend the digniti of everi individu

one of the great gift of our democraci that we have the opportun to choos our leader and peopl brave peopl go back for so mani year have fought to preserv that right and that right is under attack right now and it is under attack in north carolina of all place A state that often set the standard for move everybodi into the futur and I admir that so much emphasi on educ from liter preschool through colleg emphasi on research emphasi on job creation and innov and now north carolina under the current governor and legislatur ha been tri to restrict peopl right to vote well you know it north carolina voter though won an import victori when a feder court just struck down thi state voter ID law and the feder court brought back more day of what call onestop earli vote and here what the court said thi is not me talk thi is what the feder court said the court said the north carolina law wa design to target africanamerican with almost surgic precis now that not just happen in north carolina unfortun it happen across america and court have been overturn restrict that make it harder not just for africanamerican but lowincom peopl latino young peopl one of the provis in the north carolina law wa to make it realli hard to vote where you go to school So thi ha been a concert effort to undermin the right to vote even to make it hard for peopl with disabl to cast ballot well what the best way to repudi that kind of underhand meanspirit effort to depriv peopl of their vote get out and vote and make it clear were not put up with that these law are a blast from the jim crow past and they have no place in 21st centuri america We should be do everyth we can to make it easier to vote not harder that whi if Im elect presid I will work to expand earli vote We will enact univers voter registr so everi young person in everi state is automat regist to vote when you turn 18 and we will repair the damag done to the vote right act and take on discrimin in all form now HB two is anoth exampl of tri to discrimin against peopl that doesnt have ani place in our modern societi youv seen thi firsthand in north carolina discrimin is not onli wrong it bad for busi the nba you know cancel the game paypal cancel bring I think 400 job other are not come to thi beauti state becaus they dont want to be associ with the discriminatori bigot polici of your governor and legislatur now one thing you can do about that is chang your governor in novemb and while your at it chang one of your senat were go to need reenforc up in washington weve got a big agenda and you know peopl say to me well what is it your go to tri to get done well ill show you real easi We just publish a book right tim kain and I put thi book out it call stronger togeth it not veri long not a hard read but we have thi oldfashion idea that if were ask you to support us as presid were ought to tell you what were go to do not just bluster not just empti word not just demagog rhetor real plan that will improv your live make our countri safer and better So you can pick thi up were go to build an economi that work for everyon not just those at the top sound like a good idea were go to make the biggest invest in good pay job sinc world war II infrastructur advanc manufactur clean energi job were go to make the economi fairer rais the nation minimum wage get peopl to work full time out of poverti and we are final go to guarante equal pay for women work It is long overdu did ani of you see the democrat convent well I dont know you might have miss one of my favorit set of speaker We had these two young peopl from kansa 17 year old young man young woman Id read about thi and I said let contact these young peopl and find out their stori here their stori seventeen had the same summer job knew each other work in a pizza restaur and they were pretti excit I rememb when I got my first real job not babysit but you know actual show up at a job and have to do it and so one day after they finish work they were talk and the young woman said you know I think make 800 an hour I should be abl to at least save someth for colleg and the young man a friend of her said well Im make 815 an hour and she said well whi are you make 15 cent more an hour than I am neither of us had ani experi to do thi job were the same age He said well I dont know that doesnt sound right mayb there wa a mistak So they go to the manag they tell the manag and the manag fire them both and you know what that legal If you find out your not be paid the same for do the same job you can be fire So thi is not some madeup problem and thi would rais famili incom and if you have a mother a wife a daughter or a sister who work it your issu So were go to get that done as well and like I said were go to make colleg afford for everybodi pay down debt but were go to do someth els I think it wa a mistak when we got rid of all vocat educ in high school It need to be improv dont get me wrong It wasnt train peopl for the job that were out in the marketplac anymor but we got rid of all of it We need technic educ in high school We need more apprenticeship program where young peopl can learn and earn at the same time and were go to go back to emphas that in high school commun colleg apprenticeship program creativ idea like code camp were go to have 14 million job in 2020 for peopl who have comput scienc skill and were go to onli  if we continu on our present path onli have 400000 american prepar to do those job I want those job to be american job so were go to help train peopl of all age to be abl to do those job We are also go to defend qualiti afford health care for everybodi but were go to get the cost down were go to get the cost of prescript drug down for sure and were go to emphas two thing that we have fallen short on mental health and addict servic peopl ive met here in north carolina and across the america talk to me about that all the time So again weve got our idea in here We want you to engag with us give us your idea thi need to be an ongo convers We want you to hold us account when were in that white hous tri to do all of thi but we also have to keep america safe and we have to lead the world with steadi and strength now one of the biggest differ in thi campaign is donald trump basic say I alon can fix it whatev it is think of who that leav out that leav out our troop on the front line It leav out our polic and fire respond to emerg It leav out our teacher our educ who are work to help young peopl It leav out everybodi I alon can fix it I wa rais to believ that were in thi

theyr all tri to make him look more presidenti sound more seriou it not work too well but rememb what maya angel who spent the last year of her life right here in thi state at wake forest remind all

russian presid to our american presid that is not just unpatriot it not just insult to the offic and the man who hold the offic it is scari It is danger It actual suggest he will let putin do what

say about a republican nomine who attack america gener and heap prais on russia presid weve never seen anyth like thi and one thing you didnt hear from him wa ani plan to take on isi one of the biggest threat face our countri He say hi plan is still a secret well the truth is he doesnt have a plan I serv  I serv on the senat arm servic committe I serv as secretari of state as you know I respect the men and women who put their live on the line for the countri that I love and that I believ in So whether your passion about more good job better educ healthcar whether your passion about protect our countri and the brave men and women who serv us you have to realiz as so mani republican are that thi is a time to put countri over parti I would be say that even if I were not run against him We have never been threaten as much by a singl candid run for presid as we have been in thi elect As your commanderin chief I will not trash our countri most cherish valu I will defend them and that is especi on my mind becaus thi weekend is the 15th anniversari of 911 I wa a senat serv and I will never forget the horror of that day or the braveri of our first respond the victim the survivor peopl I had the honor to work with and repres it what kept me realli so passion involv on behalf of the peopl that I serv all dure those year and that is what I wa think of 10 year later in the white hous situat room I wa part of the small group advis presid obama whether or not the intellig we had wa good enough to take a chanc to go deep into pakistan to tri to final bring osama bin laden to justic It wa not an easi choic by ani mean these never are that whi who sit at the head of that tabl in the situat room ha to be abl to sort out fact from opinion ha to be abl to ask the hard question pursu even the most difficult lead We went through that hour after hour after hour and then the presid went around the tabl ask each of us what we advis and we were split becaus it wa not some kind of easi layup I believ it wa strong enough that we need to take action and I support take action that would determin whether or not we were success that meant send in special forc now you know what happen I wa in that situat room watch that day the most stress 30 minut of my life probabl becaus you rememb one of the helicopt nick  click on  hit it tail on the wall go into the courtyard and becam disabl that meant  thank good there were good conting plan but you had to get anoth helicopt in to take out the seal who would no longer be abl to fli out on that one but here what I want to tell you becaus it is a stori that to me illustr our valu in such a clear unambigu way youv heard donald trump say he would order our troop to tortur youv heard him say he would order our troop to kill famili member of terrorist you would know that he wa advoc illeg action against our own law as well as the law of war thank good there a code of honor in our militari stronger than the bluster and the bulli of donald trump becaus here is what happen on that night everi singl second count that helicopt had to be blown up but befor it wa  and rememb the seal had gone in they had taken out the two kuwaiti the bodyguard they had taken out bin laden son who wa there they took out bin laden they had to get hi bodi out they had to get themselv out but here what they did first they round up all the women and children member of terrorist famili they took them outsid as far from the helicopt as they could get them in order that they would not be hurt that donald trump is what american honor look like and that is what were go to stand up and defend in the face of your outrag disgrac attack on the men and women of our arm forc were go to unifi thi countri my friend We are go to bring us back togeth We are go to get thing done big thing that who we are as american I cant do ani of thi unless you join me in thi campaign you can start by go to hillaryclintoncom or text join join to 47246 you can

carolina and in america No one can sit on the sidelin the stake are high for everyon join the campaign let build a futur where were stronger togeth thank you befor they cast their vote earli or on novemb 8th So we will continu to highlight the differ and talk about what we want to do that go to make life better for the famili of america all right and Im sorri guy Im work on a featur well the middleclass is the social and econom engin of our countri It is in so mani way a reflect of the success of the unit state from the veri begin to creat greater econom opportun for peopl will to work for it and it ha been one of the premier histor accomplish of our countri go back decad if not longer and the middleclass is a hardtodefin econom target the way I talk about it is to say we know what the median incom in america is but if your live in highcost area if you have kid your tri to educ and send to colleg if you face healthcar cost that are beyond the averag stay in and progress up in the middleclass take more money in some part of america than it doe in so my pledg ha been that I will not rais tax on the middleclass and I have defin it as I will not rais tax on anyon make less than 250000 a year becaus in highcost place in america that is a  in mani way a cutoff that make sens it someth that presid obama had adher to it someth my husband adher to becaus when you look at the inform and across the countri I mean hous is so much more expens in lot of place than other place and you understand whi weve set it at that So the middleclass is both real and aspir and I want to make sure that it remain strong and it give peopl a sens of secur and confid and optim about their futur well look I am just go to keep run my campaign and do everyth I can to encourag peopl to actual get out and vote I think either donald trump or I will be the presid of the unit state and so peopl have to look care in make their decis about who to vote for becaus it will be either him or me and I am go to do everyth I can to make sure it me I am thrill of the amount of republican voter support ive gotten I realli am and from peopl who understand the stake in thi elect and are real thought leader with a lot of experi so the 50 nation secur profession who came out and said they could not support donald trump some month ago I think spoke volum about hi lack of fit and qualif for the job busi leader from mike bloomberg to meg whitman and so mani other who understand what it will take to have a competit economi that work for everybodi not just those at the top theyv been on the front line and we have an increas number of peopl who actual been republican offic holder one current one as you know congressman hanna from new york to then yesterday senat  former senat warner from virginia who I had the great honor of work with when he chair the arm servic committe So Im realli honor and proud to have the level of support and the messag that it send by peopl who understand what the next presid is go to be face and have said donald trump should not be anywher near the oval offic Oh is thi your first flight welcom aboard He can run hi campaign howev he choos that up to him Im go to keep talk about the stake in thi elect Im go to keep talk about my agenda that will I believ increas growth make it fairer have it be last deal with the real problem that famili are confront what I want to do to keep america safe and to provid the kind of steadi strong leadership that the countri need and to bring peopl togeth which is go to be one of the highest prioriti that I will have when Im fortun enough to be elect presid if that what turn out So you know Im not go to comment on how he run hi campaign youll be abl to see we have two more debat what he say and what I say well you know look we have law in our countri and the effort that trump wa make to get into the cuban market with hi busi interest ahead of the law of the unit state and the requir that hi busi were oper under becaus of the sanction show that he put hi person and busi interest ahead of the law and the valu and the polici of the unit state of america now I wa a strong support of move toward creat an open with cuba when I wa secretari of state I applaud presid obama effort and I will continu those when I am presid but donald trump knew what the law wa and from everyth we can tell by those investig report that ha been done he deliber want it and whi should it be surpris that somebodi who is happi to give hi tax return to state agenc decid whether he get to have a casino but not with the american peopl and in fact say it smart not to pay tax while he at the same time critic and denigr the unit state of america So I think it import for voter to see that thi is someon who alway put himself first and even in the cubanamerican commun there ha been a chang of opinion about what the best way to bring freedom and democraci and human right to cuba but there wa also a veri clear understand of what our law were and who they cover which wa clear and unfortun it look like he didnt pay attent to them but whi should we be surpris No No look he can say whatev he want to say as we well know we have seen it in realtim over the last mani month and Im go to keep run my campaign talk about what I think the american peopl are interest in talk about how were go to make a differ in their live I love the event I had with senat sander yesterday in new hampshir I love my colleg calcul I hope you all will write about it again becaus that what I think peopl are look for it how can we get our govern work for you how can we help you deal with the everyday challeng you face and you know thi amaz colleg calcul that our team put togeth will realli provid good inform and I want you to understand that is in line with what I want to do more of in the govern We need to use technolog more We need to get inform out We need to have you know peopl be abl to access easili inform about govern program or cost or whatev it is that on their mind So you know that what Im go to be do Im go to be talk about how we make colleg tuition free for under 125000 per famili and debtfre for everybodi els I think that  I think that what peopl care about Oh let me think look I like a lot of the world leader one of my favorit is angela merkel becaus I think she been an extraordinari strong leader dure difficult time in europ which ha obviou implic for the rest of the world particularli our countri you know her leadership and steadi on the euro crisi and her braveri in the face of the refuge crisi is someth that I am impress by ive known her for a long time she and I have known each other back in the 1990 I spent a lot of time with her and I hope I have the opportun to work with her in the futur but we

night how mani of you saw the debat well as I said I now have two grandchildren and no offens anybodi the two most wonder amaz extraordinari littl girl and littl boy and so I think a lot about the futur and you may have notic that my oppon and I have differ view  about well nearli everyth when it get right down to it not just about what make america great becaus I think america alreadi is great but about what we should do to make it even greater and about that basic question of how progress happen at all My oppon believ in what I call a strongman approach He stood on that stage at hi convent and describ a hopeless broken nation Im sorri Im look at you I dont see that that in no way resembl the strong vibrant america I know and  and here is what he said He said I alon can fix it I alon well weve learn that that hi way one person get suprem power and exercis it ruthlessli that is whi he admir dictat like vladimir putin so much but that is now how chang happen in america It is never just one person not even someon as power as the presid everi good thing our countri ha ever achiev ha alway happen becaus peopl have work togeth to make it a realiti not just the wealthi or the power all of us We see that everi day across america and I bet mani of you have been part of it mayb youv taught kid to read right Or clean up your local park Or the beach mayb youv organ a cancer walk or youv run a food drive whatev it is chanc are you have done someth to serv your commun and by extens your countri how mani of you just think back over your live how mani of you have perform some kind of servic of some sort for your commun for other peopl the reason I know you have is becaus ten and ten of million of american do some kind of volunt in your hometown everi singl year It is one of the best thing about the american peopl We are doer you know we dont just shrug our shoulder when we see someth that need fix We get resign or apathet or blame other peopl and turn on each to find scapegoat We roll up our sleev We get to work to tri to make thing better in our neighborhood our commun our citi our state and our countri that ha been our stori the american stori sinc the begin of our nation and it is still go strong today now for mani american includ a lot of you here serv our countri ha includ serv in our arm forc peopl are start to call out their servic there is no greater servic or sacrific and we are grate to our men and women in uniform to their famili and our veteran everi singl day but what so great is that nation servic can take mani differ form and it someth that I believ in so deepli that everi stage of our live give us a chanc from grade school through grandparenthood to find a way to give back weve got folk here today from americorp which my husband creat back in 1993 and I will tell you to thi day it is one of hi proudest achiev becaus everi day americorp member are there theyr build hous respond to natur disast help peopl with disabl my job find safe place to live and next week on octob 7th americorp will celebr a major mileston their one millionth member I will tell you  I will tell you bill is realli excit about thi and so am I and by the way americorp ha one of the best swearingin pledg I have ever heard here is how it start I will get thing done for america isnt that great I think we should make that a nation slogan now we also have folk here today from citi year which is part of americorp and everi day theyr work with student who are at risk of drop out of school theyr tutor and mentor and run after school club all to help young peopl realli discov how capabl they are and to be empow and to stay in school I am realli grate to them We also have peopl here today from the peac corp which repres the best of america to the world these corp volunt are teach english in kosovo  staf health center in nicaragua support farmer in nepal distribut malaria net in uganda both as first ladi and as secretari of state I got to see the result of their work firsthand they are make the world a healthier more prosper and more peac place now mayb not all of you have been a part of one of these program but I know you serv in differ way mayb you volunt through your school with your church or synagogu mayb you find through faithbas organ as I did when I wa a teenag servic opportun becaus for mani american servic is part of our faith My run mate tim kain volunt in hondura with the jesuit as a young man and it chang hi life Or mayb your whole famili volunt togeth bill and chelsea and I everi holiday season would work at a food bank back in arkansa howev you serv it feel good doesnt it To be part of someth bigger than ourselv To take our time and labor and put it toward someth good that can happen in our countri and the world and you know someth veri interest servic make us happier it make us healthier and there are studi prove that it not just how we feel theyv actual follow peopl It can also help us find our next job or our true call in life it a smart way to use our greatest asset our peopl and servic doe someth import for us as a societi too often we american can becom separ from each other and I think a lot of peopl are feel thi way dure thi elect it easi to surround ourselv with onli those who think like us talk like us look like us read the same news as us that understand to an extent but it come with a cost becaus it magnifi our differ which then make it harder to put those differ asid when our commun or countri need us there arent mani place where peopl of all age all race all background all belief come togeth in common caus but servic is one of them and that one of the reason I think it so valuabl becaus in addit to the good work it doe it help us reconnect with each other to feel more a part of our share american life I believ one of the job of the presid is to encourag more servic to help more american answer presid kennedi call you know it ask not what your countri can do for you but what you can do for your countri but you know sometim it hard to figur out how do you make a differ especi with everyth els go on in our live and too often volunt becom someth onli peopl with lot of time and financi secur can do but that not how it should be everyon should be abl to contribut So what if we as a countri made it easier for everybodi to do that for everybodi to give back what if we creat more servic opportun for american of all age invest in program that work and encourag entrepreneur to add a social compon to their busi what if we strengthen the cultur of servic in america   so it wasnt just someth we did one day a year but it becam a regular part of our live I think that would reflect our valu and tap into someth so great about america I talk a lot about how america is an except nation were not except just becaus of the size of our militari or the size of our economi were except becaus of the generos and ingenu of our peopl way back  nearli 200 year ago a frenchman came to the unit state hi name wa alexi de tocquevil He travel around He wa tri to figur out what is thi new place call america they fought a revolut what are they do who are they and he saw how we set up our govern and we had three branch and everyth that our founder realli put into place but the thing that made the biggest impress on him wa our spirit of volunteer that made democraci as divers and ambiti as our possibl If I am elect presid thi fall I want to build on that strength by make a major push in support of more nation servic So here is what I plan to do first let tripl americorp that wa the goal of my friend and the great senat ted kennedi It wa laid out in a law name in hi honor the edward M kennedi servic america act it final time we get it done everi year there are hundr of thousand of more applic for americorp than there are spot in the program So if we grow the program from 75000 annual member to 250000 were go to give more peopl who alreadi want to serv the chanc to do so and then I want to doubl the colleg scholarship that americorp member earn through their servic and I want to find way for more student to get colleg credit for servic becaus I know too mani talent commit young peopl pass up on serv with americorp becaus with their student loan they cant afford it So let lighten that burden if you do nation servic we will began a program to forgiv your loan becaus you are give back to your countri and let keep work for the ultim goal of make it possibl for ani american to serv fulltim if they want to now second let grow the peac corp sinc presid kennedi launch it 55 year ago it given nearli a quarter of a million american the experi of a lifetim and it ha foster friendship and cooper between american and peopl in more than 100 nation weve got to do more of that in the world today We need more american of all age around the world show our valu serv peopl So let make it possibl for more american to be a part of thi extraordinari program third let expand servic opportun for peopl of all age right now let be fair the younger gener is way ahead on thi ive talk to so mani young peopl who are deepli thought about how your live impact other and the world servic isnt just someth to do to check a box befor graduat It realli is woven into your live and mani who are just get start in your career say that have a posit social impact is more import to you than get a job that ye pay a salari but doesnt give you ani mean or purpos in your live and I love the fact that as you do servic you come up with new way of give back and find a path into chariti and nonprofit organ and other way to serv that a sign of true commit ive also been impress by how mani young entrepreneur tell me that theyr build a social compon into their busi whether it is dedic a portion of their profit to a chariti give employe time off to volunt or adopt a school or commun center as a pro bono project for the whole compani that whi my plan to help you refin and pay back your student loan includ loan forgiv if you launch a social enterpris or start a busi in an underserv commun We should make it easier for young innov to follow their dream while honor their valu and give back now I also want to get older american more involv servic isnt someth onli student and young peopl do I know that So I intend to make sure that 10 percent of americorp slot go to american over the age of 55 let give peopl an encor opportun after theyv end their formal career so they can appli a lifetim of knowledg and experi toward a stronger commun and final I want to creat a new mean for peopl to serv in seriou meaning way without a fulltim commit you know americorp is a fulltim commit the peac corp is a fulltim commit the arm forc are a fulltim commit but the arm forc ha anoth model the reserv right It give peopl the chanc to make a highimpact contribut while still build career and pursu their dream in other way So let do someth like that in the civilian space let call it the nation servic reserv and here the idea If you join the nation servic reserv you will receiv some basic train just like you would in the militari reserv and then when your citi or state need you youll get the call say a natur disast strike and the red cross need all hand on deck or mayb like the crisi in flint and clean water ha to be distribut everi day to a lot of famili or mayb your citi launch a major public health campaign to reduc drug abus or promot mental health you will then be sent into action now some of these assign may be just for a few day a month some might be longer term but they will directli address a vital need in your own commun and what are the other advantag becaus you can help meet that need while still be a fulltim student have a job take care of your famili you wont have to make servic your onli prioriti our goal is 5 million peopl spread across all 50 state and We will have an open door the peopl of all age but we want to put a special focu on peopl under 30 whove said again and again they want to have a bigger impact in their commun but they cannot leav their job understand well work with governor and mayor republican and democrat becaus I want thi to be a true bipartisan publicpriv partnership I also want to includ busi colleg and univers who have uniqu resourc to offer and becaus we want worker and student to know that as a they make thi contribut their school and their employ will have their back I realli think a nation servic reserv could make a differ for citi and state there so much work to be done and so mani peopl who want to help do it So let bridg that divid get peopl work togeth in way that can help commun now I do not think you will hear anyth about thi from my oppon and you know what I think that is a shame becaus nation servic ha alway been a bipartisan goal Of cours presid kennedi start the peac corp and my husband start america corp but presid nixon sign the domest volunt servic act presid georg HW bush creat the white hous offic of nation servic and both presid georg W bush and presid obama have been huge champion of servic thi should be someth that we all can get behind and  when you listen to what is be said in thi campaign it can be discourag right It can seem hard to find ani common ground So that make it even more import that we come togeth wherev and whenev we can now I am well awar that candid do not usual focu on nation servic in the final stretch of a hotli fought presidenti elect some might say well hey my gosh youv onli got 39 day to go whi arent you just out there you know beat up on your oppon and do everyth to get the vote out and all the rest of it well I will do that but ive been think about thi a long time and I did not want thi campaign to end without talk about it becaus it mean a lot to m Im tri to end the campaign focus on issu that are realli close to my heart and thi is one of them thank you you know for me servic is realli all about fulfil the instruct of my methodist faith and you can see part of  the creed I like to follow behind me Do all the good you can in all the way you can in all the place you can at all the time you can to all the peopl you can as long as ever you can now ive carri those word with me ever sinc I heard them as a littl girl and it an idea that realli got into my head and my heart but you know what kept me go are the peopl that ive met In a countri found on liberti and equal I cant think of a more import notion than everi one of us is valuabl We all deserv respect We all should listen to each other We all can make our mark on the world and when we come togeth in common purpos we can do so much more than we can ever do on our own that whi stronger togeth is more than a slogan it a cours of action So here what I want to do I want you to hear me pledg that thi will be a vital aspect of my presid and I want you to help me bring our nation togeth to solv our problem strengthen our commun to join with peopl across america who care about servic becaus it speak to both what is great and good about the unit state you know america is great becaus we are good So there are lot of exampl were gonna be put exampl up on my websit of peopl who have serv and who are inspir but I want everybodi here to know that it can be done We can do more and we can provid the opportun to enlist more peopl there are so mani exampl in

here My husband is come back tomorrow for a twoday bu tour through ohio and I will be back becaus we care about ohio and we want to make sure ohio make the best choic for the futur of the peopl of thi great state now Im go to close thi campaign the way that I start my career a long time ago fight for kid and famili stand up for peopl who may need a littl extra boost in life make sure that thi countri deliv on the promis of the american dream see I believ the american dream is big enough for everybodi If your will to work for it and do your part you should be abl to get ahead and stay ahead in america now my oppon and I have a realli differ view about what it take to get ahead and stay ahead and that may be becaus we have veri differ life experi and you know that OK peopl have differ famili differ view of the world but here what I have notic I have notic that he alway put himself first and mayb that becaus he wa born into a millionair famili he start hi busi with a 14 million loan from hi father hi father bail him out appar that a pattern youv got to be bail out when you do busi with him and he then ha taken advantag of everi singl element of our tax code of our economi that he could and along the way  along the way he ha stif peopl small busi and worker and contractor and that part of the reason I take thi elect so serious My dad wa a small businessman My grandfath wa a factori worker and so my dad when he got out of the navi in world war II he start a small busi He start a print busi He print fabric for draperi and you know he work realli hard He had a print plant in chicago No natur light no window just a long room where there were two big long tabl and the fabric would be laid out on them and then if youv ever seen silkscreen that what he did you take the silkscreen you put it down you pour the paint in your take the squeege you go across you lift it up you go down to the end of one long tabl you start on the end of the other long tabl and then if it wa go to be two color you would add anoth color do exactli the same thing It wa befor there wa machin My dad couldnt have afford that anyway but he work realli hard and he produc a good middl class life for our famili So when I think about the way that my oppon ha taken advantag of peopl ive got to tell you I am realli grate my dad never got a contract from him becaus I have met peopl he stif I have met peopl Im talk painter and plumber Im talk dishwash marbl instal glass instal architect A man who sold him piano for one of hi casino He wouldnt pay them now youv got to stop and ask yourself what kind of person doe that somebodi who work hard and ha a contract which they expect to be honor and so I met one of the men I met a man who had a small famili busi instal the glass in one of those casino submit the bill and trump said no were not go to pay it and the man wa stun As so mani hundr and hundr of peopl have been and then they come back the trump organ or trump himself and say OK well give you 10 cent 20 cent mayb 30 cent on the dollar now some of those small busi couldnt afford that they had bought the materi they had provid the servic trump didnt care He basic just walk away from them made them feel like they had fail even though they had done the work theyd been ask to provid ive got to tell you that is not the way were suppos to do busi in america and  and I cant imagin have a presid who believ that that the way your suppos to treat peopl but your go to help me make sure he never get near the white hous now earlier today earlier today in toledo I talk about all of the chang I want to make in how we can protect american from the kind of corpor fraud that we have seen too much of now the most recent exampl is well fargo well fargo actual had peopl thousand of their employe put custom into account they either never ask for or they did not understand and then everi time they put somebodi into a new account they got fee which then gave them the chanc to get a bigger bonu A realli crummi game that hurt peopl So thank we have an organ now the consum financ protect bureau in washington that look out for peopl who get defraud like that that is an import part of how we are go to protect peopl and it is run you may know by richard cordray from ohio now will it surpris you that donald trump want to elimin that agenc well were not go to let that happen that agenc ha alreadi recov 11 billion for consum who have been taken advantag of by corpor and the behavior of well fargo show clearli that we have got to keep the pressur on these big bank so they can never wreck the economi again the way they did back in 2008 I have said we are never go to let wall street wreck main street again and I mean it contrast that  contrast that with my oppon He want to do away with the rule that have been impos on wall street He basic want to let wall street the bank the hedg fund all these other institut basic do whatev they want again I tell you what We are not go to let that happen We need more rule not fewer rule on them I want us to make it easier to start a small busi to get rid of the red tape to make credit avail to make it clear that most new job are go to come from small busi in america So we should have a big dynam small busi economi but we are not go to let big busi and big corpor call the shot anymor that is not work for us but trump whole econom vision is realli trickledown econom it the same idea that ha fail us befor you see he believ that all you do is cut tax on the wealthi and then it trickl down well we know that doesnt work weve been down that road and what he want to do is I think it fair to say trickl down on steroid what he ha propos would slash tax on the wealthi now Im a littl confus about thi becaus for a long time weve been say hey where are your tax return A lot of us wonder what he wa hide becaus you know if it wa someth that would make him look good he would put them right out there everybodi who ha ever run for presid in at least the last 40 year ha releas their tax return My husband and I have about 40 year of tax return out there you can go and look at them and you can see that you know we paid a lot of tax and frankli we were grate we could We are grate for the bless that we have had over the last 15 year So did ani of you see the debat last monday well you know I rais it I said well OK what is he hide mayb he not as rich as he claim mayb he is not as charit as he claim mayb he doesnt want us to see that he owe hundr of million of dollar to foreign bank and foreign lender Or mayb he hasnt paid ani tax now shortli after the debat it wa discov that inde back in the 1990 he appar lost a billion dollar on bad invest and fail casino ask yourself thi who lose money on casino realli and you know yesterday  yesterday some of hi support said well it just show that he a geniu that he didnt pay ani tax well what kind of geniu lose a billion dollar in the first place you know in the debat he said not pay tax made him smart but think about what that mean It mean that all the rest of us who pay our tax right what he say about us but more than that zero tax mean zero for our vet zero for our militari zero for pell grant to send young peopl to colleg zero for health zero for educ and you stop and ask yourself thi is the same person who been go around realli just dump on america He said our militari is a disast well he could not be more wrong but thank good the rest of us pay to support our men and women in uniform who have done so much for us today in colorado he claim he brilliantli use the law to avoid pay tax well that just show number one he is the poster boy  the poster boy for the same rig system that he would make even wors just think about it He paid zero at least for about 20 year we believ now base on what we know and he is advoc for huge tax cut that would help him and hi famili even more what doe he want us to do pay him to lose money realli but you know you know there a lot more to thi stori and we are just slowli get it into the public eye So we know he stif peopl didnt pay hi bill We know he took bankruptci depend on how you count four or six time you know that he paid no tax for probabl 20 year We dont know what hi tax would be after that He ha alway talk about how he cant releas hi tax becaus he is under audit but he admit everyth befor 2009 is not under audit So donald releas everyth up until 2009 show the american peopl your tax ill tell you anoth thing If I am  if I am fortun enough to be presid we are go to pass a law requir anybodi who is a nomine of a major nation parti to have to releas their tax So what did we find out today well a stori just came out say that donald trump use chines steel and aluminum for two out of the last three construct project So instead of buy hi steel and aluminum from american plant here in ohio and pennsylvania instead of support hardwork famili and american job he onc again stif us He sent that money oversea now he spend a lot of time bash the chines right you hear that all the time when he talk well turn out he bought hi steel and aluminum from the chines and it turn out he owe big money to the chines So thi is anoth one of the episod of hi realiti televis show where he is say one thing and do someth els now for year china ha been undermin american busi and worker by illeg dump cheap aluminum and steel into our market you know that right and it sound like donald trump ha been buy that dump steel and aluminum how can he make america great again when he wont even buy american product in our countri and ill tell you thi is person to me becaus as a senat I went befor the intern trade commiss on behalf of steelwork in new york who I repres and as secretari of state I went toe to toe with the chines I have put forward an agenda to crack down on trade abus from countri like china to stand up for american worker and to rebuild american infrastructur with american materi like steel and aluminum and today in toledo I point out becaus chrysler just announc an expans of the plant there for the new jeep wrangler about 700 more job right I point out when the automobil industri wa flat on it back and 850000 worker in ohio could have been absolut out of a job more than we can even imagin in term of a longlast impact on the economi here donald trump said he didnt care save it dont save it didnt matter to him well ill tell you where I stood I stood in favor of save the american automobil industri and look what we got last year our auto industri had the best year they have had in a realli long time and so we have got to keep build it weve got to keep make sure that there are good job and weve got to protect good union job against the kind of assault that is come from all side So now I know that ohio is a tough state youv got to get out there and youv got to talk to peopl answer question make your case that what weve been do that what we are go to do all the way to the end of thi elect but I need your help to talk to anybodi you know here who think they might be vote for trump I know you know peopl I know you do and youv got to stage an intervent youv got to sit them down and point out how everyth he say he want to do is absolut opposit of what he ha done and how everyth he ha propos will help peopl like him and hi famili but not the vast major of famili in ohio In fact if you look at hi tax propos they benefit him and other wealthi peopl hedg fund manag and the like and they would actual rais tax on the middl class famili now that the kind of contrast we are get out in the campaign but that whi we need your help to make sure you go out and talk to everybodi and you know I know peopl want chang that part of the american dynam spirit We want chang but ill tell you one thing that is certain is we will have chang it just what kind of chang it whether or not we have chang that help the vast major of american hardwork american middleclass famili or continu to onli help those at the top I want an economi that work for everyon not just those at the top and that exactli what we are go to fight for and that is what we are go to get I tell you ive been call a lot of thing right ive never been call quitter If I tell you Im go to get up everi day and fight for you that is exactli what I will do but I know I cant do it  I cant do it alon you know donald trump stood on the stage of hi convent and just onc again paint thi dark and dire pictur of america and he said I alon can fix it He get confus between leadership and dictatorship He ha a hard time rememb who our friend are and who our adversari are He ha a weird fascin with dictat like vladimir putin We have a lot of peopl live in thi part of ohio who either themselv or their parent or grandpar came from countri that were under the yoke of oppress and we are never go to let that happen again and so when trump basic sign up for putin wish list that bad enough but then when he is cavali  and Im not talk about basketbal  when he is cavali about nuclear weapon say that he doesnt care if other countri get them In fact you know if there were nuclear war in east asia japan got nuclear weapon if south korea got nuclear weapon hey you know go at it folk He even said he wouldnt care if saudi arabia got nuclear weapon one thing that ha been a bedrock of american foreign polici through democrat and republican presid go back to the dawn of the atom age is we were commit to tri and keep other countri from get access to nuclear weapon to be abl to stop prolifer and now it even more import becaus it not onli state that we have to worri about like north korea weve got to worri about terrorist get their hand on nuclear weapon the last thing we want to do is just act like it doesnt matter becaus it doe I wa involv in put togeth the sanction against iran that drove them to the negoti tabl and what I learn If you use diplomaci and your tough about it you can actual get an agreement to put a lid on their nuclear program and we are go to make sure they follow it to the period the comma everyth in that agreement Im go to enforc and we still have challeng with iran but I think we are in a stronger posit given the fact that they are not race for a nuclear weapon becaus we have intrus inspect So I know diplomaci can work becaus I have done it and I know that We can defeat isi and the terrorist if we work with other nation if we have a coalit that actual take them out from the air take them out on the ground and fight them onlin where they are do so much damag by radic and recruit young peopl ive been lay out my plan for what I think it will take to defeat isi and I have no doubt we will and donald say he ha a secret plan that he wont tell us about well there no secret he ha no plan weve got to do more  weve got to do more to make sure we protect our countri We need the best intellig we can get the best cooper among law enforc at all level of govern I will not rest you know as a former senat from new york on 911 I take thi as a person respons I will do everyth I can to keep our countri safe and to work with other to defeat the threat pose by terror final my friend weve got to bring our countri back togeth there is too much divis too much fingerpoint and scapego you know our divers is one of our strength We have to listen to each other We dont have to agre that not requir but we need to be respect We need to listen and then we need to roll up our sleev and get to work when I wa first ladi senat secretari of state I work to find common ground with everybodi I work when I wa first ladi with republican and democrat to creat the children health insur program that ensur 8 million kid when I wa in the senat I work with practic everi republican I serv with and you know they all have nice thing to say about me when I am not run for someth and I will work again to move our countri forward and to chang the economi so it work better for hardwork peopl and when I wa secretari of state we negoti a treati with russia to lower nuclear weapon to tri to lower the threat of that and we had to get 13 republican and I work tirelessli and we got them We did that there a lot we can do if we start listen and respect each other and avoid the kind of namecal and insult that we see too much of So Im excit about the campaign but Im even more excit about get to work for you be abl to get up everi day and find a way to tri to help somebodi I mean that is how I wa rais in my church and by my famili and that is what I have done through my advocaci work and my legal work on behalf of peopl who need a voic and I will do everyth possibl to make sure I deliv result for you and the reason the reason that I have publish a book with my great run mate tim kain  it right here Is real simpl I want you to know what we say we are go to do becaus I want you to hold me account I dont believ in bait and switch where I say we are go to do someth and then I am realli over here do someth els that kind of remind you somebodi doesnt it No here what were go to tri to do were go to pay for it by rais tax on the wealthi and close loophol on corpor and I am the onli candid who ran thi whole campaign say I will never rais tax on the middl class that is not go to happen when I am presid So pleas join thi campaign the last 36 day talk to your

the stage a lot of folk were hang out of the window and were glad that youv got the best view of what were do here it also excit to be here with two week left becaus thi is the most consequenti elect of our lifetim and to see the energi and the enthusiasm that thi crowd display  I saw it yesterday in north carolina I saw it the day befor in ohio It realli doe demonstr that american are look at what at stake and are come to the conclus that we all have to be involv involv in the remain day of the campaign and that everyon need to turn out to vote and here in new hampshir you have a lot of reason to vote youv got great candid for the congress anni kuster and carol shea porter who deserv your support and youv got a great candid for governor colin van ostern thank you I know that  you

hous and boy it is excit to be here with maggi and elizabeth becaus they are peopl who fight for you everi singl day I know both of these women and it is a privileg to be on thi stage with them now elizabeth warren ha a track record of make it her mission to stand up against wall street and she go to make sure that wall street never wreck main street again but you may not know that she wa the person behind set up the agenc that protect consum the consum financi protect bureau and it wa set up to stand against and do someth about the kind of fraud and abus weve seen from well fargo and they are on the front line of return billion of dollar to american who have been cheat and defraud by big compani by bank and other you know in fact I think it fair to say some of the best TV that you can see is on cspan when elizabeth is go after a bank execut or a regul she refus to let them off the hook and she not just speak for herself is she she is speak for everi singl american who is frustrat and fed up and I am so look forward to work with her to rewrit the rule of our economi to make sure we both grow it and make it fairer for everi singl person work hard here in america I dont know  were up here without our phone so we cant check tweet but I kind of expect if donald heard what she just said he tweet away she get under hi thin skin like nobodi els whether she call him out about hi mysteri tax return she expos him for what he is  temperament unfit and total unqualifi to be presid of the unit state and maggi is go to be a great unit state senat for new hampshir you know you dont have to take my word or elizabeth word look at what she ha alreadi done under maggi leadership new hampshir ha the lowest unemploy rate in the entir countri dure her governorship it wa rank as the best state in the countri for busi and she done it the new hampshir way she ha brought peopl togeth democrat republican and independ I think she ha the biggest legislatur probabl in the world that she ha to deal with So she ha realli hone her skill about listen and then tri to work with peopl and she taken on issu that realli do keep famili up at night from the skyrocket cost of colleg and prescript drug to help student figur out way to afford to get their educ to help those suffer from addict or mental health to rais wage for hardwork famili what I love about maggi is that she is independ she know how to find common ground and how to stand her ground and that is exactli the kind of leader we need in the unit state senat becaus weve got to break through the gridlock and the dysfunct that ha unfortun mar washington We have got to get back to listen respect We can disagre without be disagre and that whi we need leader like maggi and unlik her oppon she ha never been afraid to stand up to donald trump she know he shouldnt be a role model for our kid or for anybodi els for that matter So I hope in these next 14 day you do everyth you can to support her and I want to say a word about colin who I have also known for a number of year now and maggi is leav some big shoe  she doesnt look like it but she is she leav some big shoe to fill as governor and colin is the person for that job you know as a member of the execut council and I rememb thi becaus it took a lot of gut he help lead the fight to protect fund for plan parenthood in new hampshir against hi oppon by the way and he ha shown that he will stand up for women health 100 percent of the time not just when it polit conveni He also work with maggi to cross parti line to help expand medicaid to more than 50000 granit stater and colin want to do more to invest in clean energi like wind and solar to hold down energi cost to creat more good job here in new hampshir and to protect the beauti environ of thi state and he will fight to put into action the promis of higher educ within reach for more famili So pleas dure these next day make sure your do everyth you can for colin for carol and for anni now

chanc to get ahead and work with our commun colleg we need to make sure that everi young person and everi person come back to upgrad or chang skill can go to a commun colleg and ye we are go to make fouryear colleg afford you know just thi week a new report came out show that new hampshir student have veri high level of debt and I know maggi ha been fight that and she had a moratorium and she done what she could at the state level but we got to work togeth at the nation level to make thi happen for student in new hampshir famili in new hampshir So after our primari wa over and  you know what I wa realli proud I wa realli proud of the campaign that berni sander and I ran and it wa a  it wa a campaign  it wa a campaign about idea not insult and that what campaign should be about and after it wa over berni and I got togeth we put our head togeth and we came up with a plan to make public colleg and univers tuitionfre for ani famili make less than 125000 a year and if you make more than that it will be debtfre In other word pay what you can but let not have kid and famili go into debt to get an educ thi should be an invest that we make on behalf of them and our countri futur and no matter where you go to a great school like thi or anywher els we will help you pay down your student debt well make it easier becaus were go to make it as a percentag of your incom so your never on the hook for more than you can afford and if your interest to see how much you and your famili could save you can actual go to hillaryclintoncomcalcul to see how much you can save under thi plan that we are propos now I think in addit to grow the economi we need to do a lot more on small busi twothird of new job will come from small busi So were go to be just focus on how we make it possibl to start and grow your small busi and then we do  we do have to make the economi fair and that start with rais the nation minimum wage becaus if you work fulltim Im talk about fulltim worker you shouldnt still be in poverti at the end work should provid a ladder of opportun for peopl will to work for it to climb right and we are go to guarante equal pay We are go to make afford childcar so nobodi pay more than 10 percent of your incom for childcar were go to work for paid famili leav becaus thi is the way famili are today you know were not live in the 1950 famili are under new stress and strain and I meet so mani who are realli just at the edg they are make all they can make one parent work fulltim two parent work fulltim sometim parttim on top of fulltim and the other day tim kain and I were in pittsburgh and there wa a long line of peopl a big overflow which you know we couldnt get into the main room where we were So tim wa talk to the famili there and there wa a woman there hold her 3yearold child a daughter I think and you know tim wa shake hand and the woman look he said I  she said I came here hope I could tell you or secretari clinton that I had my babi three year ago and the day after I had my babi I wa fire becaus I call and ask if I could have a few week becaus it had been a difficult pregnanc and my babi wa fine but not all that she need to be I got fire and tim came in and you know he such a wonder man what a fine fine human be and he said to me you know there are reason everi day whi I get so motiv in thi elect and I just  I just have anoth reason and he told me that stori I think your presid should care about that I think your presid should wake up everi day think OK how do I help empow peopl to make the most out of their own live you know how do I knock down the barrier that give you the chanc to go as far as your hard work and talent will take you and then sometim peopl say well how are you go to get all thi done and  I have propos plan that do not add a penni to the debt becaus I see some of my longtim friend who were back in the 92 campaign and you know when my husband end up we had a balanc budget and a surplu and actual we were on the way to pay down the nation debt but here what happen what happen is tickledown econom came back So here what Im gonna do were go to ask the wealthi to final pay their fair share were go to  were gonna close the loophol We are go to end the fact that millionair can pay a lower tax rate than a nurs or a teacher or a polic offic were gonna make big bank pay for the risk they pose to our economi becaus elizabeth is absolut right No  no bank is too big to fail and no one should be abov the law So were go to enforc that and contrast that with donald trump He believ if you give trillion  and that trillion with a T  in tax cut to the wealthi millionair billionair and corpor everyth will work well it will for him that trickledown econom on steroid and he would wipe away the tough new rule that presid obama impos on wall street He would elimin the consum financi protect bureau that elizabeth did so much to creat and you know that wa bad enough but then in the debat we learn he ha not paid ani incom tax for year So he hasnt paid a penni to support our militari our veteran pell grant for kid to get an educ health or anyth els and hi explan wa well he lost 1 billion in a year now ive ponder thi ive realli ponder thi He actual said it made him smart not to pay incom tax but how smart are you to lose 1 billion in a year and  I dont  ha anybodi here ever been to a casino He lost 1 billion run casino who doe that ive never heard of anybodi So weve got to make it clear that donald is not on the side of american worker or american famili you know for all of hi talk about put america first he make hi product in at least 12 other countri He stiff small busi momandpop contractor who work for him My dad wa a smallbusi owner He work realli heard Im just glad he never got a contract from donald trump becaus it wa hard work and peopl who do that work should be reward not taken advantag of So we  we know a lot about how donald trump work and today  today we heard yet anoth stori it about a mainten worker at one of hi golf cours thi mainten worker told hi cowork he wa gay and they start harass him they use antigay slur to hi face they threw rock and golf ball at him hi supervisor saw it and did noth and it got so bad he wound up in the hospit final he went to the polic for help He couldnt go back to work becaus he wa too scare for hi safeti and then he wa fire by trump golf club now thi is a heartwrench stori on a lot of level for starter it is a pain remind of the harass violenc and discrimin that too mani lgbt american still face everi day and it is deepli disturb that instead of step in to stop the tormentor trump golf club turn on the victim for come forward If that how donald trump run hi busi what doe that say about how he would run our countri So

talk about what a great boss he is while he wa watch and listen to them and today in open that hotel I think it import to note that he onc again reli on undocu worker the same peopl he ha been insult and demon throughout thi campaign So like with so much els that donald trump say he say one thing and then he doe someth differ mani of the product in the hotel were made oversea rather than here in the unit state and he even su the district of columbia to pay lower tax that is the way that he doe busi now weve actual learn in thi campaign that donald trump is the poster boy for everyth wrong with our economi He refus to pay worker and contractor from atlant citi to miami to la vega He stiff small busi I take that one person becaus my dad wa a small busi man and ive met so mani peopl who

and republican togeth to tri to protect our environ and fund everglad restor He will stand up to the gun lobbi and advoc for common sens gun safeti measur hell defend social secur and medicar not cut or privat those two essenti program So pleas do your best to make sure we send patrick murphi to the senat now I got to ask you did anybodi see the last debat you know I have now stood next to donald trump for fouranda half hour prove conclus that I have the stamina to do the job and everi time he say one of those outrag thing that he doe have a  ye wrong  he doe have a way of say I just keep rememb michel obama word when he goe low we go high but ive got to say he said someth in the last debat weve never heard from anybodi run for presid He basic said that he not sure  he refus to say that he would respect the result of the elect now thi is a guy that said the emmi were rig so you cant realli take what he say you know veri serious but thi is a problem becaus the first thing a presid doe at noon on januari 20th is to take an oath to preserv protect and defend the constitut and if you are cast doubt you want to keep peopl in suspens as to whether you will respect the outcom of an elect that is contrari to who we are as american We have our elect weve had them from georg washington forward and were go to keep have them and show what a democraci look like to the rest of the world I believ strongli that the american peopl are go to reject thi dark divis vision of america and it happen my friend We have reach a mileston more than 200 million american are regist to vote that the biggest number ever and that number includ 15 million young peopl and you know what els more than 10 million peopl have alreadi vote includ 2 million right here in florida Im hear some great stori from peopl let me just tell you one it about stephen from saint augustin he been fight a rare form of leukemia and heart diseas he been in and out of the hospit a dozen time in the last two year but he know how import hi vote is So I heard yesterday he ditch hi oxygen tank which I would not have recommend  clung to hi walker stood in line so he could cast hi vote for a better america and If stephen can do that nobodi ha ani excus and I think thi extend not just to democrat but to republican and independ and I am proud to have support from republican and independ here across florida and across america  who agre with me that we should reject hate and divis We have seen donald trump insult nearli everi person in america and I just  I just find that so intoler becaus look at thi divers crowd look at tampa it a cosmopolitan citi florida  florida is pave the way for what our countri will look like and we need to be lift each other up listen to each other respect each other not sew seed of hatr and bigotri and I think one of my biggest job after thi elect will be bring our countri togeth and Im gonna need your help were go to get the economi work for everybodi not just peopl at the top with new job and infrastructur that  that rail that system bob  that you want were go to get it becaus it would help you so much think of the peopl wed put to work technolog innov research advanc manufactur and ye small busi I want to be the best small busi presid you can have to help peopl start and grow their busi but were also go to make america the clean energi super power of the 21st centuri I know we can creat million of job and we can protect florida especi coastal florida and we could protect our planet at the same time you know your alreadi see the result of climat chang here in florida you know I wa just in miami and they actual have flood on sunni day with no rain peopl are call 311 becaus they think a water main broke but it the ocean rise So I know there is no state that could benefit more from a clean energi agenda than florida and that exactli what were gonna do were also gonna make public colleg and univers tuition free If your famili make less than 125000 which is most famili in america your not gonna have to pay a penni to go to a public colleg or univers If your famili make more than that your not gonna have to go into debt pay what you can afford and then were go to make sure you can go without get a big debt becaus that drag peopl down and for peopl who alreadi have debt we are go to help you refin it and pay it off and I wanna say someth to all of the teacher and educ I want to work with you and be a good partner with you and I think there should be more than one way more than just a fouryear colleg degre to get a good job with a good middl classlif for you and your famili So let invest in more technic educ in high school and our commun colleg let have more apprenticeship program labor and busi togeth but while we grow the economi let make it fairer We need to rais the nation minimum wage so that peopl who work fulltim arent left in poverti you know I gotta tell you I wa rais to believ in hard work My grandfath wa a factori worker my dad had a small busi and we realli believ you gotta work for what you get in life right but if your work you shouldnt be at the point where you cannot even afford food or cloth or rent at the end of the year and isnt it final time to guarante equal pay for women work you know thi is not just a women issu thi is a famili issu If youv got a mother a wife a sister or a daughter work it your issu and unlik my oppon were go to ask the wealthi the millionair and billionair to pay their fair share becaus were go to close the loophol and make sure no multimillionair ever pay a lower tax rate than a nurs or a teacher or a polic offic or a fire fighter and I will not rais tax on anyon make less than 250000 a year So when you go to the poll vote to grow the economi more job with rise incom vote to make the economi fairer and compar that with what my oppon ha propos He realli believ if you give trillion  that trillion with a T  trillion in tax cut to the wealthi millionair billionair big corpor everyth will trickl down now we know that doesnt work weve seen it and it pretti rich come from a guy who claim to be so rich who hasnt paid a dime in feder incom in 20 year He say not pay tax make him smart well I dont know  I dont know how smart you have to be to lose a billion dollar in one year and besid what kind of geniu lose money run a casino for heaven sake actual it sound like a few peopl have been at casino here but you know thi mean he contribut zero OK He actual ha a gall to call our militari a disast not onli is he wrong but what right doe he have to say that He hasnt contribut a penni to our militari not a penni to our veteran not a penni to healthcar or educ not a penni to highway or infrastructur thi is  thi is a fals  fals charg that he make about all the problem in our countri and ill tell you someth we did a littl research he been denigr america for decad thi didnt start with hi birther lie against presid obama it didnt even start run against me back in 1987 he took out a 100000 ad in the new york time critic presid regan He said our leader were the laugh stock of the world So thi is a guy who critic everybodi but himself and at some point youv got to say wait a minut were better than that We are stronger than that We want to move forward forward into the futur with confid and optim and that what were offer in thi campaign ive got to tell you it is not just what were against that should motiv you to go to the poll it what we are for and I believ strongli that what were for will make it possibl for all of us and especi our kid and our grandkid to have the best futur america best day can still be ahead of us but we cant make ani of thi happen if we dont have you vote now donald trump say he can still win and

school zone on day one go back to the day when insur compani could discrimin against us if we have a preexist condit let wall street write it own rule deni the scienc of climat chang roll back marriag equal defund plan parenthood  the hugest tax break ever for the wealthi and a broad abandon our allianc and allow more countri to get nuclear weapon now that may be chang but boy that not the chang we

peopl are work in good highpay job and in new industri like clean energi and advanc manufactur I want us to be a countri where hardwork immigr who pay tax  and by the way onehalf of undocu worker pay feder incom tax which mean they are pay more feder incom tax than donald trump pay and a countri where we not onli have equal pay for our work but afford childcar where were respect in the world work

and for all that love trump hate thank you wow thank you so much and hello kent state and happi halloween everybodi It is great to be back in ohio even if the world seri is make life veri stress for cub fan everywher I want to thank bruce blair for that introduct and for hi servic to our nation I think everi american should hear hi stori over the next eight day befor they vote I also want to thank everyon who wa part of the preprogram In particular let me thank senat sherrod brown such a great senat My dear friend and great congressman tim ryan state repres john boccieri state repres kathleen clyde and let me thank kent clark the acapella group that sang dure the preprogram My friend we are about to enter the final week of thi elect so I want to come back to ohio one of the most competit and consequenti battleground state in the countri to talk about what at stake in thi elect but let me start with thi Im sure a lot of you may be ask what thi new email stori is about and whi in the world the fbi would decid to jump into an elect with no evid of ani wrongdo with just day to go that a good question and first of all for those of you who are concern about my use person email I understand and as ive said Im not make excus ive said it wa a mistak and I regret it and now they appar want to look at email of one of my staffer and by all mean they should look at them and I am sure they will reach the same conclus they did when they look at my email for the last year there is no case here and they said it wasnt even a close call and I think most peopl have decid a long time ago what they think about all of thi now what peopl are focus on is choos the next presid and command in chief of the unit state of america and did ani of you see the debat well I think it wa import becaus I had a chanc to talk about my 30 year of public servic and my plan for our countri and then peopl could weigh that against what my oppon ha done and said I am run against a man who say he doesnt understand whi we cant use nuclear weapon He actual said then whi are we make them and he want more countri to have nuclear weapon japan south korea even saudi arabia imagin imagin nuclear weapon smack in the middl of the middl east and if your tell yourself hell surround himself with smart peopl who will stop these crazi idea rememb thi when he wa ask who he consult on foreign polici donald trump said he didnt need to consult becaus and I quot I have a veri good brain He say he know more about isi than our gener do No he doe not and of cours the peopl donald trump ha around him includ two men whose activ are reportedli be investig for their tie to russia vladimir putin and putin alli So in these last day let not get distract from the real choic in thi elect and the consequ for your futur I start say last june I believ that donald trump ha proven himself to be temperament unfit and total unqualifi to be presid and command in chief and ive got to tell you I did not take ani pleasur in say that I have known I have known for year now peopl who ran for presid republican and democrat and I have my differ with republican and even with democrat but I never doubt their fit to serv donald trump is differ that as seriou as it get So today I want to talk about nation secur becaus when the elect is over and peopl wake up on novemb 9th we will have pick the person who will carri the respons for all of these weighti decis and that should realli convinc anyon how high the stake are in thi elect I just want to focu on three of the most crucial question face the next presid can you be trust to command our nuclear arsen and make liter lifeanddeath decis about war and peac how do you handl a crisi and do you know the differ between our alli and our adversari well start with nuclear weapon now I know there are some who will say that ani discuss of thi topic could be fearmong but I dont think so and in part becaus of what you just heard from bruce blair when dozen of retir nuclear launch offic publicli state that donald trump should and I quot not have hi finger on the button then thi is a topic that cant be avoid and as ive said donald ha repeatedli suggest more countri should have nuclear weapon He must not realiz or care that the more nuclear materi there is in the world the more like terrorist are to get their hand on it or that someon will miscalcul and start a war that cant be stop and when a few more countri go nuclear their neighbor will feel pressur to do so as well one of the reason I work so hard to impos sanction on iran so that we could get them to the negoti tabl wa so we would not have a nuclear arm race in the middl east and I am proud that we put a lid on iran nuclear weapon program but even the prospect of an actual nuclear war doesnt seem to bother donald trump good luck enjoy yourselv folk wa what he had to say about a potenti nuclear conflict in asia I wonder if he know that a singl nuclear warhead can kill million of peopl these are weapon today far more power than the bomb that destroy hiroshima and nagasaki dure world war II To talk so casual so cavalierli about mass annihil is truli appal presid ronald reagan onc said and he work hard for arm control and I admir what he did work with the soviet union and he onc said he fear and thi is a quot from presid reagan some fool or some maniac or some accid trigger the kind of war that is the end of the line for all of us that ha been the fear and the commit of democrat and republican presid sinc the dawn of the atom age So what would he think about donald trump who say he want to be and quot unpredict about use the most power weapon ever produc and here the thing with nuclear weapon As bruce told you when the presid give the order that it there no veto for congress no veto by the joint chief the offic in the silo have no choic but to fire and that can take as littl as four minut that whi all those retir launch offic step forward and said donald trump should never be put in charg of our nuclear arsen and when you heard from bruce blair hi stori is worth rememb In 1973 bruce wa a young militari offic work in an underground bunker in montana hi job wa to launch as mani as 50 nuclear weapon if the presid ever gave the order then one night in octob as the unit state and the soviet union squar off over an escal conflict in the middl east the emerg messag he had train for arriv prepar for nuclear war like other american offic in bunker and submarin and bomber around the world bruce and hi colleagu start the process becaus that wa their duti they unlock the safe they took out the launch code and the key and then strap into their chair to brace for the shockwav that would come if a russian warhead deton abov them then they wait for the final order from the presid thank it never came but when bruce look at donald trump he see hi hairtrigg temper and he think about what it felt like insid that bunker that night As ive said mani time a man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapon and that bring me to the second question I think voter should ask about both candid how do you handl a crisi weve seen in thi campaign that donald trump lose hi cool at the slightest provoc when he gotten a tough question from a report when he challeng in a debat when he see a protest at a ralli when he confront with hi own word so imagin him in the oval offic face a real crisi imagin hi advis afraid to tell him what he doesnt want to hear race against hi legendarili short attent span  to lay out lifeanddeath choic too complex to be reduc to a singl tweet and then imagin him plung us into a war becaus somebodi got under hi veri thin skin now thank he never been in a posit where he had to help make lifeanddeath decis for our countri but there wa one nation crisi where we did get a good look at how donald trump handl himself donald is a new yorker and hi finest moment in thi campaign wa when he defend new york against ted cruz attack in a debat and he invok the day after 911 when new yorker realli came togeth to take care of each other I couldnt agre more that whi it wa so upset to learn what donald wa actual do on 911 after the world watch with horror as the twin tower fell he call in to a new york TV station and even on that horribl day when thousand of peopl lost their live he couldnt stop himself from point out that now becaus the tower had fallen a build he own wa the tallest in lower manhattan what kind of person brag at a moment like that ill tell you someon who should never set foot in the oval offic and serv as command in chief you know for me I take thi veri person my friend becaus I wa one of new york senat along with chuck schumer on 911 He and I were on the ground the veri next day meet with the governor the mayor emerg offici and I will never forget the site of ground zero the thick smoke made it hard to breath or see some of the firefight and other first respond we met had been on duti nonstop sinc the plane hit the tower they had all lost friend In a makeshift command center we were brief on the damag and it wa clear we were go to need a lot of help to recov new york and we were go to have to realli make it our absolut mission to not onli rebuild new york but to keep america safe that what I did for eight year as a senat I never stop fight to keep our countri safer and to ensur that first respond got the medic care they need and I think it import to reflect on what each of us ha done in moment like that becaus a lot of the crise that come at a presid are not predict they happen ill tell you a quick stori It wa after presidentelect obama ask me to be secretari of state but befor the inaugur and I got a call to come to an emerg meet in the white hous in the situat room and the new obama nation secur team wa on one side of the tabl and the outgo bush nation secur team wa on the other side and the bush administr had gotten credibl intellig that there wa go to be an attack at our inaugur So even befor we were swornin to do our job we were face with help to make such a consequenti decis It realli matter what your experi ha been what your valu are whether you can be count on to make that decis you learn a lot about peopl in moment like that and as I sat there with the pressur on have to think through in my own head how we evalu thi intellig how we did everyth we could to preserv our inaugur of our first africanamerican presid on the mall in washington  we made the decis to go forward obvious some of you might have been there but we also did everyth we could to doubl our effort to find out about the intellig and to secur the hundr of thousand of peopl who would be there So you have to ask yourself in a crisi who would you trust who will listen to good advic keep a level head and make the right call becaus that the person you want as our presid and command in chief now let get to the third question for all of the voter to consid about each of us Do you know the differ between our alli and our adversari now thi may seem like an easi question If you got it on an exam I think youd be abl to answer it but appar it hard for donald He ha pick fight with our friend I mean the presid of mexico the british prime minist the german chancellor pretti much the entir nation of japan and he even pick a fight with the pope and at the same time he is prais tyrant and dictat like saddam hussein and kim jongun in north korea and bashar alassad for their suppos strong leadership He even prais the chines govern for massacr protest in tienanmen squar trump ha repeatedli suggest he would abandon our alli in europ and asia he call nato quot obsolet obsolet nato is the greatest militari allianc in the histori of the world and it base on someth it base on someth call articl five which say an attack on one is an attack on all and articl five ha onli been invok one time when our alli came to our defens after 911 We still have nato alli fight sidebysid work sidebysid with american troop in afghanistan they join us in go after al qaida and bin laden now were suppos to tell them we wont have their back and by the way right now our nato alli are help identifi and track terrorist who threaten america and europ theyr host radar and missil defens instal that protect us against potenti threat from iran and elsewher and as our nato forc in afghanistan stand shouldertoshould with american troop they share the risk and burden now theyr move into the baltic state to deter russian aggress treat our alli like the small busi and contractor that trump exploit and stif in atlant citi hang them out dri would make our countri and our world less safe and it would also play right into the hand of russia and china which are enviou of our allianc and eager to see them weaken and fail but mayb that the point becaus what most strike about all of thi and I would argu most import for voter to consid is the relationship between donald trump and russian presid vladimir putin As former secretari madelin albright put it and I quot here We have never seen a mind meld of the kind between the russian leadership and a candid for the presid of the unit state michael morel who ran the cia and grew up just a few mile from here ha said that putin is manipul donald putin is a train intellig offic from the old kgb He know he can use flatteri to get into donald head to make donald the kremlin puppet and it seem to be work donald ha signal to putin that he will let russia do whatev it want from ukrain to syria and beyond he even said putin is a stronger leader than presid obama  and it get wors the US intellig commun ha now confirm that the russian govern which mean putin is direct cyberattack against target in the unit state to influenc the outcom of our elect So ask yourself whi would putin be tri to get donald trump elect presid could it be becaus of all the nice thing donald ha said about him or the fact that he ha promis to adopt pro kremlin polici Or mayb becaus of the extens busi deal with russian oligarch with tie to putin now sinc donald wont releas hi tax return and dont hold your breath  we dont know the full extent of hi busi relationship but what we know is disturb and we know thi We are deal with someth unpreced in the histori of our countri a foreign adversari tri to influenc our presidenti elect that should scare everyon democrat republican and independ and with the elect just eight day away thi cant wait ani longer donald trump should immedi disclos all of hi tie and connect to the kremlin and it associ the american peopl deserv to know the full extent of these link and how they relat to what the russian are do in our elect becaus when you step back and take it all in it no surpris that 50 republican nation secur expert wrote an open letter say they will not vote for donald trump becaus he would be in their word the most reckless presid in american histori and it no surpris that not a singl former presid secretari of state or nation secur advis from either parti ha endors him and it no surpris that bob gate bob gate who serv eight presid over 50 year democrat and republican alik ha said trump is and I quot beyond repair stubbornli uninform about the world and how to lead our countri and govern temperament unsuit to lead our men and women in uniform unqualifi and unfit to be command in chief unquot So I hope you and voter across ohio and america will think about all of these nation secur issu when you cast your vote in thi elect think about what it take to lead and how we want to secur the safeti of our countri our children and our grandchildren and who best prepar to do that becaus make no mistak that realli is what on

with you on behalf of cincinnati and ohio and america and whether or not I get the chanc to serv you realli depend on what happen in thi elect now earlier  earlier today  earlier today I wa up at kent state  a great univers  and I told them about some of the reason whi I think it realli import to get everybodi out to vote in thi elect but I start by say you know there thi new email stori about you know whi in the world the fbi  would decid to jump into an elect without evid of ani wrong do with just day to go that a realli good question but I want you to know look ive said repeatedli On  I  you know I made a mistak Im not make ani excus but I will tell you thi if they want to look at some more email of one of my staffer by all mean go ahead look at them and I know they will reach the same conclus they reach when they look at my email last year right It wasnt even a close call and I think most peopl have move on theyr look and focus on OK who is go to be the next presid and commanderinchief did ani of you see  did ani of you see the debat ani of you see the debat I  I got a littl bit of a chanc you know I did stand there for fourandahalf hour with donald trump prove conclus I have the stamina to do the job but  but I did occasion get the chanc to you know ask peopl to take a look at my 30 year of public servic my plan for our countri what tim kain and I have said we want to do and then weigh that against my oppon what he done and said I  I am run against someon who say he doesnt understand whi we cant use nuclear weapon He actual said then whi are we make them He want more countri to have nuclear weapon he mention japan south korea even saudi arabia now if you are hope that he might surround himself with good peopl who would stop hi crazi idea rememb thi when he wa ask who he consult with on foreign polici donald trump said he didnt need to consult becaus and I quot I have a veri good brain He said he know more about isi than our gener do No donald you dont and of cours the peopl that donald trump ha around him includ two men who activ are also reportedli be investig becaus of their tie to russia vladimir putin and their alli So in these last day let not get distract from the real choic in thi elect donald trump ha proven himself to be temperament unfit and total unqualifi to be presid and commanderinchief I have to tell you that  it doe not give me ani pleasur say that it not a small thing I  I have watch and known a lot of the peopl who have run for presid both republican and democrat and look ive had my disagr with republican I might have disagre on polici or principl but I never doubt their fit to serv in thi offic donald trump is differ and that whi there is so much at stake in thi elect He ha a dark and divis vision for america that could tear our countri apart abraham lincoln understood a hous divid against itself cannot stand and that wa over the greatest of challeng the challeng pose by slaveri and we fought a civil war but we also have to take stock of how divid we are today the kind of divis that need to be heal to bring peopl togeth I will tell you thi I want to bring not just democrat but republican and independ peopl who will vote for me and peopl who vote against me togeth becaus I have a veri differ vision of america instead of dark and divis it hope and inclus it big heart not small mind It is about lift peopl up not put them down it a vision that say and I believ thi with all my heart We are stronger togeth and  america is great becaus america is good never forget that ye we have our flaw of cours were onli human but what we have done over the cours of our histori to keep widen the circl of opportun and equal and freedom is unlik ani other place in the histori of the world So we want an america where women are respect  where our veteran are honor  where parent and famili are support and worker are paid fairli and we believ in an america where marriag is a right and discrimin is wrong  an america that lead in the world and live up to our valu where everyon count everyon ha a place and the american dream is big enough for everybodi So the choic could not be clearer and the stake could not be higher when I wa at kent state talk about the threat that donald trump pose to our nation secur I wa realli struck It wa a veri big crowd and it wa primarili student and you know I thought to myself well Im not go to give a rahrah speech becaus I realli want to talk about what thi mean to nation secur and I wa introduc by a gentleman name bruce blair a former air forc offic in charg of the nuclear code and key a launch offic and he came out for me along with more than 30 launch offic and basic they said we cannot support donald trump becaus he should never ever be near the nuclear code and key and even the prospect of an actual nuclear war doesnt seem to bother him good luck enjoy yourselv folk is what he had to stay about a potenti nuclear conflict in asia I wonder if he even know that a singl  a singl nuclear warhead can kill million of peopl you know that is whi dozen of retir nuclear launch offic took the unpreced step in say that donald trump should and I quot not have hi finger on the button and when it come to handl a crisi weve seen in thi campaign that donald trump lose hi cool at the slightest provoc when he gotten a tough question from a report or when he challeng in a debat or when he see a protest at a ralli when he confront by hi own word So imagin him in the oval offic face a real crisi imagin him plung us into a war becaus somebodi got under hi veri thin skin I hope youll think about that when you cast your vote in thi elect think about what it take to lead in a veri complic world and in who hand you want to put the safeti of our children and grandchildren and think about the differ between elect a presid who will do noth and a presid who will tackl the epidem of gun violenc in america you know as gabbi know so well 33000 american a year are kill by gun thousand more are injur it an averag of 90 peopl a day die here in ohio more peopl are kill by gun than die in car crash We have seen moviego gun down in theater littl children kill in their classroom clubgoer massacr in orlando nine faith peopl murder at bibl studi in charleston south carolina and weve seen far too mani young africanamerican men and women kill by gun violenc which is now the lead caus of death for young black men and when we think about that we think of dontr hamilton or jordan davi or trayvon martin and other ive had the great honor of get to know their mother who have turn their grief into action and their mourn into a movement but here what I want to say if anyth els in our countri were kill as mani peopl peopl of good faith peopl who believ like we do in the 2nd amend peopl who own gun peopl who go hunt peopl who are collector we would say hey wait a minut thi cant go on We need comprehens background check to close the gun show loop hole close the onlin loop hole and we know here in ohio a major of gun owner support these common sens step to prevent gun violenc becaus they know we can respect the 2nd amend and keep our kid and commun safe at the same time and we need to keep gun out of the hand of suspect terrorist If you are too danger to fli you are too danger to buy a gun period and look there is  there is a veri clear differ donald trump wont stand up to the gun lobbi he sold out to them In fact the gun lobbi is spend more on ad to get donald trump elect than ani other group more than 7 million in ohio alon and in return donald trump ha promis to repeal presid obama action to strengthen crimin background check donald say gun should be allow in nightclub that serv alcohol he even said on hi veri first day in offic he would requir everi school in america to let peopl carri gun into our classroom how can anyon think our school will be safer with more gun So I have stood up to the gun lobbi for year  which is whi they are run all these ad against me  and I will stand up to them as presid I will work with gabbi and mark and american for respons solut to pass common sens reform becaus weve got to keep gun out of the wrong hand and help save live I will also get up everyday in the white hous work my heart out for you whatev I can do to knock down barrier to empow peopl To get the economi work for everybodi not just those at the top that how I wa rais I wa rais to believ that if you work hard  and I believ in hard work  you should be abl to get ahead and stay ahead in america and I will never ever quit on you when I tell you Im go to tri to do someth that will make a posit differ in your life I dont care what the polit or other barrier are were go to find a way over under around or

theyv announc it their strategi is get women to stay home get young peopl to stay home and get peopl of color to stay home it all part of hi scorch earth campaign but actual add up to more than half of our whole popul when you stop to think about it and it goe against everyth we stand for So if your as upset as I am by the campaign that he ha run the thing he ha said insult not just women but immigr latino african american prison of war muslim veteran the militari I mean the list goe on and on it almost imposs to understand how somebodi could run for presid who seem not to like america as much as he doe So you know the best way to stop him By show up with the biggest turnout in histori We need more american to vote and I think we have a chanc to get more american from all walk of life

sure that everi voter in florida spend these next seven day think about what at stake in thi elect becaus honestli I believ thi may be the most import elect of our lifetim one week from today we will be choos or next presid and commanderinchief of the unit state I dont  I dont think the choic could be ani clearer you know I have spent my career fight for children and famili I have serv in the unit state senat serv on the senat arm servic committe I wa in the situat room when we bought osama bin laden to justic I repres you as your secretari of state go to 112 countri negoti with friend and foe alik I am readi to serv if you give me the great honor of be your presid now I do have to say that I think that stand in contrast to my oppon and you know mayb for you if you think about all of the issu that separ donald trump from me it could be hi danger statement about nuclear weapon when a journalist told donald trump that peopl were worri about how causal he talk about nuclear weapon he said well then whi are we make them and I have to tell you yesterday I wa in ohio and I wa introduc by a gentleman who wa one our offic in charg of watch nuclear weapon if the order ever came from our presid and what he told the crowd it wa a big crowd at kent state univers I think everi voter should hear basic hi name wa bruce blair he said that have had the respons of sit in a bunker be respons for the code and the key to our nuclear weapon he know that when a presid make the order to launch a nuclear attack there is no appeal there is no veto and that is whi he ha join with dozen of former air forc offic to send a letter to say we need a presid with the tempera the steadi the calm to be in charg of nuclear weapon and therefor they cannot support donald trump becaus he doe not have the tempera to be our command in chief and handl those respons So when you think about vote  earli vote thi week vote next tuesday  respons for our nuclear weapon is on the ballot So is immigr Do we want to round up million of peopl who are here work rais their famili as he ha suggest he will do I dont think so I think what we want is to bring them out of the shadow so that they cant be exploit by employ by employ like donald trump who refus to hire american and hire undocu worker so he could pay them less I dont think that right now mayb for some of you what donald trump said about prison of war will be enough reason to vote against him somebodi wholl question the patriot and the servic of john mccain becaus he wa a prison of war We need a command in chief who respect the servic and sacrific of the men and women who wear our uniform Or mayb for some of you it what he said about a judg born in indiana who just happen to be assign the case brought by peopl who were defraud by the phoni trump univers and so trump said well we cant trust him becaus hi parent were born in mexico now paul ryan the republican speaker of the hous call well but wait a minut He call what trump said about that distinguish feder judg the definit of a racist comment and then trump went on to attack a gold start famili whose son capitan kahn die defend our countri simpli becaus that famili wa muslim and then let not forget trump spent year  year insist that presid obama wa not born in the unit state even after the birth certif wa produc honestli if thi were someth new I  I think wed all be ask ourselv well what  what doe he have against presid obama Or what doe he have against me but thi is not new I know Im reach out to republican and independ as well as democrat becaus I want to be the presid for all american and here what I want you tell  I want you to tell your republican friend in 1987 donald trump took out a 100000 ad in the new york time to critic presid reagan He said our leader are the laugh stock of the world So thi is a man who think that he is better than presid reagan better than presid obama liter better than anybodi I guess and when you think about it what he said at the convent I alon can fix it run counter to who we are as american We work togeth So there are mani reason whi I think it is fair to conclud that donald trump is unqualifi and unfit to be presid but today I want to just spend a few minut focus in particular about what he ha said and what he ha done to women and girl becaus  you know ani of you see the debat you know I stood next to donald for four and half hour for those three debat prove conclus I have the stamina to be presid of the unit state and dure those debat you know donald alway use to say what have you been do for 30 year and I alway found that kind of odd becaus he could googl it and find out and so you know ive been a lawyer ive been a first ladi and ive been a senat and ive been secretari of state ive been a wife and a mother and a grandmoth and a friend and a churchgoer and for my entir life ive been a woman and when I think about what we now know about donald trump and what he been do for 30 year he sure ha spent a lot of time demean degrad insult and assault women and I got to tell you some of what weve learn  some of thi stuff is veri upset I would frankli rather be here talk about nearli anyth els like how were go to creat more good job and get the economi work for everybodi not just those at the top how were go to make colleg afford for everi singl famili becaus I have a plan that if your famili make less than 125000 you will not pay tuition to go to a state colleg or univers and if your abov that it will be debt free and we help you pay back the debt you alreadi have so you can get out from under it but I cant just talk about all the good thing we want to do becaus peopl are make up their mind thi is a consequenti choic So weve got to talk about someth that frankli is pain becaus it matter We cant just wish it away and you know a lot of hi support dont like to hear thi I dont blame them If I wa support him I wouldnt want to hear it either to be honest but I got to tell you I learn way back in elementari school and I learn it in sunday school you know it not OK to insult peopl it not OK and look at what he doe he call women ugli disgust nasti all the time He call women pig rate bodi on a scale from one to ten We just heard from alicia she wa miss univers when donald trump own the pageant well he said she put on some weight and it made him angri so he call her miss piggi call her miss housekeep becaus she a beauti latina He brought a bunch of report to a gym to watch him order her around to exercis now you know he also said thi is somebodi who like to eat

thing who act like thi and ill tell you who a bulli that who and thank alicia refus to let such a small person get her down she know that donald trump donald trump doesnt get to decid her valu in her eye and in the eye of her famili and her friend but what about our girl what about girl watch all thi what happen to their confid their sens of self worth If youv got a daughter a granddaught a sister a mother a wife a good friend someon like thi becom presid who insult more than half the popul of the unit state of america and what about our boy thi is not someon we  we want them look up to you know not so long ago I wa the mother of a teenag girl and you know everi day I tri to make sure she knew that she wa smart and she wa capabl and Im do the same thing with my granddaught and my grandson becaus let be honest here the world ha a way of tell our girl exactli the opposit they dont look right theyr not thin enough they dont act right No one will like then unless they chang their cloth or straighten their hair or stop be bossi or whatev the critic might be right and I rememb when chelsea wa a teenag I would wait on the second floor of the white hous in the long hall that there for her to come home from school and sometim we onli had a few minut togeth but befor shed run off to talk to her friend or do whatev she wa plan to I would figur out kind of how were the  how wa the

you can go back and  and find what he said about all kind of folk and one of the thing I discov in prepar for the debat which I wa kind of surpris by is that he took out a full page in 1987 to critic presid reagan so he is an equal opportun insult you know but I did choos a differ path from him ive spent my career fight for kid and famili and Im proud that I have I help to start someth call the children health insur program as first ladi It cover eight million kid and I have to tell you that travel around pennsylvania  realli anywher in the countri  I meet peopl who have been affect by the

and you know if you dont have your health it pretti hard to get ahead right and so I meet famili who tell me about what that meant and it make me veri grate and I wa a senat from new york on 911  and

believ that if you want to get thing done thatll help peopl you start by listen to peopl bring them togeth and I know that is not veri excit I admit and I do feel kind of sorri for the press cover me becaus what are they go to say for the 100th time she wa listen to peopl I get that but everyth ive done start there and then you bring peopl togeth you put them around the tabl they dont all agre with each other and then you work to find common ground that what I did in the senat and as secretari of state I couldv never gotten anyth done if I hadnt work with republican  and other who had differ point of view and I want you to know if you elect me on tuesday that is the kind of presid I will be listen  learn find common ground and from the veri first day of thi campaign ive been put forward my idea about how to help you and your famili get ahead and I truli believ you deserv a candid you can vote for not just someon to vote against and so you can go to my websit tim kain and I wrote a book call stronger togeth becaus I want you to know what the agenda is and I want you to hold me account when I come back to pittsburgh which I hope to do on a regular basi  I want peopl to say hey you know I saw where you want to do more on infrastructur how that go how mani new job do we have what kind of opportun do we have with clean renew energi job what about rais the nation minimum wage now one way or anoth america is go to have a new presid on januari 20th right and peopl say all the time that they want chang well we will get chang chang is inevit that is certain the question is what kind of chang are we go to have and  and here where I think the choic could not be clearer are we go to build a stronger fairer better america Or are we go to fear each other and the futur hunker down against each other I dont think that will lead to anyth posit and what I hope we will do in thi elect and in these remain four day is to think about the kind of countri we want imagin what we can do togeth everi time I come into pittsburgh now becaus I start drive through pittsburgh decad ago becaus my dad wa from scranton and we drove through pennsylvania everi year We took differ rout and we went to differ place and I  with my own eye  have seen the up and the down of thi great citi and now when I drive in what do I see I see a posit optimist confid citi make progress move forward and I dont think you do anyth in life unless you kind of imagin what it will look like and then you get to work to do it that how mark ha built these great compani right here in pittsburgh when he wa a young guy and work hard for everyth he had He got a chanc to start imagin and then he got a chanc to start act and produc result well that the way it work that the way it work with the steeler right I mean peopl imagin what the team can be like they plan the coach they work hard the player like mel and franco they practic they plan you dont just say hey just get out on the field do whatev you want that not the way it work my friend and so what Im hope is that we will imagin two differ america just for the sake of thi exercis imagin it donald trump stand in front of the capitol and we alreadi know a lot about him someon who demean women mock peopl with disabl insult african american and latino and demon immigr and muslim and pit peopl against each other instead of pull us togeth and think about what it would mean to entrust the nuclear code to someon  with a veri thin skin who lash out at anyon who challeng him imagin how easili it could be that donald trump would feel insult and start a real war  not just a twitter war  at 300 in the morn imagin what it would mean for our economi to have someon who built hi career exploit worker stif small busi now you heard earlier from andrew tesoro He design a build for donald trump trump told him he love it it wa at one of hi golf cours and then trump would not pay the bill now andrew didnt have the resourc to sue the trump organ So trump just walk away from what wa owe thi is someon who person sign  not some execut  he person sign a contract with a unionbust firm to keep worker at one of hi hotel from be abl to organ and bargain collect and just yesterday donald trump wa told he wa break the law by not negoti with hi hotel worker in la vega and we know  and the steelwork sure know  he chose to build two of hi build with chines steel and aluminum instead of support america steel industri and american steelwork everywher he goe he leav peopl behind you know one of my goal as presid is to encourag more compani to do what mark did with profitshar If ani of you were with us when mark endors me tim kain and I were here in pittsburgh and he talk about how he had share the profit of hi compani includ the profit he gain when he sold hi compani I think you told me mark you made 300 millionair at your first compani look weve got to have a strong privat sector we need busi to be creat more job I realli like the kind of job and busi that mark doe becaus what he is to worri about and take care the peopl who help made him success in the first place now imagin have a presid who owe hundr of million of dollar to foreign bank and other foreign entiti that he doesnt tell us about ask yourself so if he sit across the tabl negoti with peopl from those countri is he go to put hi own financi interest ahead of america interest I can tell you thi when Im sit across the tabl from the russian or anyon els I know who Im repres the american peopl and our interest now my friend we got some good news thi morn our economi creat 161000 job last month that is that is 73 straight month of job growth and I believ that our economi is pois to realli take off and thrive but we need to make sure the economi is work for everyon not just those at the top and that is my pledg I believ in growth from the middl out and the bottom up when the middl class thrive america thrive donald trump believ someth differ he want an economi that work for him that whi he want to give the biggest tax break in histori to the super wealthi and big corpor hi own famili would get a 4 billion tax break now  figur that out We know he hasnt paid tax right If it turn out that he as rich as he claim it would be trickl down econom on steroid the wealthi would be pay lower tax rate than ever hi plan  and thi is what I want you to hear  so he take care of himself he take care of hi famili he take care of the super wealthi and corpor hi plan would actual rais tax on 26 million lowincom and middl class peopl He would hit especi hard  51 percent of singl parent would see their tax go up that mean that 316000 work famili in pennsylvania would pay more under donald plan honestli I dont know how he live with himself doesnt he see  doesnt he see what we see the million of mom and dad struggl to make end meet balanc the demand of work and famili Or doe he just not care rememb thi is a man who said pregnanc is an inconveni for an employ He ha said and I quot put a wife to work is a veri danger thing well I see thing differ when I say we need to make the economi work for everyon not just those at the top I mean everyon famili are face a lot of pressur In mani famili women are contribut to the incom of their famili or they are the sole  the sole incom in the famili more peopl than ever are work gig on the side just to make extra money or to make end meet and for work famili the cost of everyth is go up from childcar to prescript drug to colleg educ and I think we all know somebodi who work two minimum wage job and tri to rais their famili at the same time it hard be good worker and good parent and we know young peopl who want to start a small busi the way mark did it when he got go and mayb they want to buy a first home or they just got marri and theyr tri to get ahead in life but student debt is hold them back and I want us to know that I will do everyth I can to help eas the cost of middl class and work and poor famili so that more peopl  can do better and right now so mani of the peopl  so mani of the peopl who are do the toughest most import job in our countri are get paid the least and a lot of them are women and peopl of color right childcar worker tri to take care of our kid  nurs who work the night shift and spend more time with their patient than the doctor do the home health aid who keep our senior independ and healthi there are so mani job of valu to our societi where the paycheck dont reflect how import they are So I will do everyth I can to get incom rise for hardwork peopl whether you work in steel whether you work in a factori whether your a machinist a nurs a teacher a firefight a polic offic whatev you are you deserv to be part of a grow thrive

chanc and the opportun you deserv to have I want you to have a candid you can vote for not just someon to vote against that whi tim kain and I have run a campaign base on idea and issu not insult becaus if you realli take a look at what at stake in thi elect it is a choic between two veri differ vision for america ive got to say when I hear my oppon talk about america I dont recogn the countri he talk about It is so dark so divis so hate that is not the america that I believ in I believ that we should have a confid optimist inclus vision of where were go and how were go to get there I love our countri and I believ in the american peopl and I think there noth we cant achiev if we work togeth and we set some goal and we go after them  see we believ in an america that is bigheart not small mind We believ in an america that is alreadi great but can be greater if we do our part and we believ america is great becaus america is good never forget that If we lift each other up and not tear each other down we can go even further and I believ with all my heart that whi the slogan of my campaign sum it up that we are stronger togeth and so come next januari 20th america is go to have a new presid I know that a lot of peopl say that they want chang well let me tell you thi chang is inevit there will be chang the question is what kind of chang are we go to have are we go to build a stronger fairer better countri Or are we go to fear the futur and each other I sure hope not that is not the america that I believ we are So here what I want to ask you to do I want you to talk to your friend and your famili your neighbor michigan is one of these state that doesnt have earli vote ive been all over the countri go to state that are alreadi vote In fact about 31 to 32 million peopl have alreadi vote in those state but michigan vote on tuesday and I imagin I imagin there are some of you who know peopl who say theyr go to vote for donald trump right I know I understand that I mean I would hope youd tri to stage an intervent befor it too late but mayb you can ask them with you to imagin imagin januari 20th 2017 and imagin that my oppon is take the oath of offic in front of the capitol imagin have a presid who demean women and mock the disabl who insult africanamerican and latino and muslim who person engag in bust union and prevent peopl from have the right to bargain collect now the truth is we realli dont have to imagin what that would be like becaus everyth he ha said and done both in hi career and in thi campaign tell you what could happen you know michel obama who say so mani wise and wonder thing she said the presid doesnt chang who you are It reveal who you are and I think weve seen who donald trump is maya angel anoth great american maya angel said when someon show you who he is believ him the first time and if my oppon were to win we would have a presid who ha onli ever been in it for himself just last year he said again it wouldnt have matter if wed rescu the auto industri or let it go bankrupt what is he talk about Im proud that presid obama save the auto industri and Im even prouder that becaus of the hard work of peopl in detroit and across michigan and the midwest the US auto industri just had it best year ever If donald win the elect we have a presid who want to ban everi muslim in the world from come to visit the unit state We are a countri found our religi freedom that run contrari to our constitut We would have a presid who ha said repeatedli that he think the live of the black peopl are all about crime and poverti and despair He ha no idea about the strength of the black church in the vibranc of blackown busi the excel of histor black colleg and univers He seem to know noth about the rise of a new gener of black activist and the success of black leader in everi field I think he need a visit from reverend wendel anthoni dont you yesterday in north carolina I wa honor to stand with a woman name may brown wiggin decad ago she wa a hardwork nurs in new york citi she wa look for an apart that she could afford to rent but donald trump and hi father fred turn her away you see whenev africanamerican tri to rent trump apart their applic wa mark with a C C for color and that didnt sit veri well with may so she went to the author and eventu the depart of justic su the trump for hous discrimin and although they settl they wouldnt chang So the govern had to take them back to court that a pattern thi is what happen time and time again with my oppon If he were to win he would be in charg of the feder hous depart If he doesnt respect all american now how can we trust him to serv all american in the futur He ha such a casual disregard of our constitut He doesnt seem to understand that the rule of law that we realli are a nation of law not men here the latest exampl there is a terribl crime back in 1990 in new york citi It wa call the central park five mayb some of you have heard of it there were five black and latino kid some as young as 14 they were wrong convict and they were in prison where they spent year donald trump took out fullpag ad call for the death penalti for the kid and even after they were exoner by dna evid as someon els confess to that terribl crime trump actual said they should still be in prison It doesnt matter if you are innoc If he decid that you should be in prison or you should be lock up No wonder he admir vladimir putin becaus that exactli what putin doe to hi peopl So we cant trust him with our constitut We cant trust him to obey the rule of law He ha shown us who he is now we have to decid who we are So let me paint you a differ pictur here what were go to do togeth if we win thi elect on tuesday night We have three big three big challeng number one weve got to get the economi work for everyon not just those at the top number two weve got to keep our countri safe and we have to work with our alli to lead the world with strength and intellig for peac and prosper and number three weve got to bring our countri togeth weve got to overcom these divid We have to heal our nation and I hope that you will help me meet all three of those challeng I have said repeatedli that were go to take on discrimin and bigotri becaus ani time we hold somebodi back it can lead to hold other peopl back We cant accept as normal what were see across our countri becaus of hi campaign A church in mississippi wa burn thi week someon paint vote trump on the side and then set it on fire We cant let that happen what happen in flint michigan should not be normal or accept our kid should be guarante clean air and clean water those are basic and weve got to do everyth we can to make sure that we take care of our children and it import for us to recogn that when I talk about get the economi to work for everybodi that mean I want the biggest job program sinc world war II infrastructur advanc manufactur clean renew energi technolog some peopl say we cant do that well Im tell you they are wrong they are wrong We have the best worker the most product worker were go to give them more to work on more product to produc and were go to do more for small busi becaus small busi is the backbon of so mani commun I want everybodi to have the chanc to succeed in america that mean were go to dismantl the socal school to prison pipelin and replac it with a cradl to colleg pipelin were go to make sure that everi child ha a chanc to go to a good school with good teacher no matter what zip code that child live in and I want to start with our youngest kid with prekindergarten program and then I want to be abl to partner with our teacher weve got to have high expect and get result in help our children and I want to be sure that we put technic educ back into high school becaus there are good job out there wait for young peopl with the skill to do them It will be import that we creat an environ in which our polic and our commun can work togeth and trust each other I believ we are all safer when everyon ha respect for the law and everyon is respect by the law and that what were go to work for were also go to take commonsens step to reduc gun violenc and save live thi ha noth to do with the scare tactic come from my oppon have you seen he start to wear a camo hat now realli We are go to work with respons gun owner who understand that weve got to keep gun out of the hand of peopl who shouldnt have them in the first place and while we creat more safe commun we want to invest in those commun I want to continu the good work that our past two democrat presid have done one name clinton one name obama and I want to be a realli strong partner ill compet a littl with them but I want to be a real strong partner with detroit and other citi that are on the way back up to make sure you get the invest and the support the hous and the job that you need but we also have to make sure our economi is fairer that whi I believ we should rais the nation minimum wage becaus peopl who work fulltim should not be left in poverti and isnt it final time to guarante equal pay for women thi is not a woman issu If you have a wife a mother a daughter or a sister who work it your issu it a famili issu and everi time I talk about want to have afford childcar paid famili leav equal pay for women the other side accus me of play the woman card ill tell you what If stand up for equal pay is play the woman card then deal me in and one of the other one of the other big challeng were go to take on I am so excit about thi you know Im realli proud of the campaign that berni sander and I ran becaus it wa a campaign about issu and what we decid after it wa over is how we can work togeth to make sure that everybodi who want to go to colleg can afford not just to start but actual to graduat So we came up with a plan that if you go to a public colleg or univers you will go tuition free if your famili make less than 125000 a year and it will be debtfre for everybodi abov that so you dont go into debt for peopl who alreadi have student debt were go to help you pay it down and pay it off to get out from under it and I want especi to support histor black colleg and univers that have done so much to bring forth a leadership cadr in our countri thi is just some of what we are offer in thi campaign becaus we realli believ you need to look at what will happen after the elect now I had a friend say to me the other day you know peopl are just frustrat and angri I get that I understand that We had the worst econom collaps sinc the great depress in 08 and 09 million of peopl lost their job million lost their home famili wealth wa wipe out that is a trauma and peopl are still suffer and still climb back from that I get it but I learn a long time ago from my late mother anger is not a plan all right Be angri vent about it and then roll up your sleev and get to work that what I will do that whi we put thi all down it on our websit

view of our countri sometim when I hear him speak I honestli dont recogn the countri that he is talk about sometim Im not sure he recogn the countri he talk about did ani of you see the debat did you all see the debat well I did spend fourandahalf hour next to donald trump in those debat prove conclus I have the stamina to do thi  but but it also but I  I think it  it  it also import that we believ in a hope inclus bigheart unit america right where everyon ha a place where everyon is includ where peopl who are will to work hard can get ahead and stay ahead where we recogn the import of the american dream and we believ and we will ensur it is big enough for everyon not just a few So I  I realli believ that although my name and my oppon name may be on the ballot come tuesday what realli on the ballot is what kind of countri we want for our children and our grandchildren what realli on the ballot is everi singl issu we care about our constitut set up a system of govern that ha stood the test of time It can sometim be frustrat provid challeng  we know that but here we are the longestlast democraci in the histori of the world that is to be cherish and nurtur not demean not degrad now if you believ that our brave men and women in uniform like captain khan deserv a commanderinchief who know what need to be done then you have to vote dont leav it to chanc dont leav it to other use your voic and your vote becaus my oppon actual said more countri should have nuclear weapon and when a journalist ask him about use nuclear weapon he said well whi do we make them I wonder if he even realiz he talk about nuclear war the other day in ohio I wa at kent state univers and I wa introduc by a man name bruce blair He had been in the air forc decad ago and he wa a launch offic in our nuclear program which meant that he sat in a bunker dure hi watch time in case the presid  whoever the presid wa  were to order a nuclear attack and bruce blair know there is no appeal from a presid order to launch a nuclear attack there is no veto by the joint chief of staff or anybodi els If a presid order a nuclear attack there about a fourminut window befor it happen I had never met Mr blair befor he gone on to have a veri distinguish career in secur studi but as he wa watch thi campaign and reflect on the servic he did as a young man he realiz he could never support donald trump and he call other launch offic  sometim call missil  and ask them what they were think and to a person they said thi is unaccept thi is actual scari So sever dozen of them wrote a letter say that they know what the awesom respons is that a presid of the unit state hold and they could never support donald trump to be our presid and commanderinchief and if you  if you believ like I do that our economi grow and america thrive when the middl class grow and thrive then you have to vote too were go to make the biggest invest in goodpay job sinc world war II  job and infrastructur and advanc manufactur and clean energi small busi job I want to be the best small busi presid weve ever had  to enabl more peopl to get start and grow their busi In contrast my oppon built hi fortun on the back of small busi owner but Im the daughter of a small businessman and I am just so glad my dad never got a contract from donald trump becaus so mani who did were stif but I want to make sure that we have easier access to capit less red tape more tax relief for peopl will to take the risk of go in to small busi I also think it imper that we make our economi fairer and that mean I do support rais the nation minimum wage becaus as I said I believ in work that how I wa rais and I think we can do better for peopl who work fulltim and still are mire in poverti We want to get back to have ladder of opportun If you work in america you ought to be abl to get ahead in america and were go to make that happen again and weve got to start recogn that famili need more support and that whi I want to make child care afford instead of cost as much as tuition and it is time that we had paid famili leav so that you can take care of the most import oblig that you have and it is way past time to guarante equal pay for women work and you know thi is not just a woman issu thi is a famili issu If you have a mother a wife sister or daughter thi is your issu and thi is an issu worth vote on becaus it time we made it fair for work women and if you believ all of our kid should have the chanc to thrive in good school with good teacher no matter what zip code they live in then you have to vote becaus weve got to make public educ work for everyon and I think we need some water ye  do we have some water that we can get here If we  if we have some water that would be a big help okay great now look I  I think when it come to educ we do need to have highqual afford prekindergarten in everi commun I also believ we need to bring back technic and vocat educ into our high school becaus a fouryear colleg degre should not be the onli path to a good job and a middleclass life in new hampshir or in america and for anyon who doe want to go to colleg we are go to make it afford now after the primari wa over  and I have to say you all clean my clock in the primari I know but it wa a great primari becaus it wa about idea and issu not insult and Im proud of the race that senat sander and I ran and  and when it wa over  when it wa over we got togeth and we sat down and we said how can we work to deal with a lot of the issu that we were both concern about in the primari and weve put togeth a plan  public colleg and univers should be tuition free for everyon who make less than 125000 a year and it should be debtfre for everyon els We have to treat it like an invest and berni and I were just in north carolina campaign togeth and it so excit becaus we know that not onli do we have make colleg afford we also have to help the million of american who are alreadi struggl with student debt to eas that burden get those interest rate down make it so you never have to pay more than you can afford So you see work for children and famili ha been the caus of my life but it never been more import than it is right now and  and it will be our mission togeth do everyth we can to help all our kid and everi american have the chanc to live up to their godgiven potenti I am take veri serious the oblig that I feel to reach out to all american Im ask for the support not just of democrat but also republican and independ in thi elect I want to be the presid for all american  those who vote for me and those who do not vote for me becaus we have to heal thi countri and that go to take everyon We have to rememb how to disagre without be so disagre and you know it is unusu for somebodi run for presid to say that what we need more of in our countri is love and kind but we realli do  toward one anoth toward peopl differ from ourselv We all have a role in build a better stronger fairer america and I am veri honor to have gotten the kind of support I have receiv from republican here in new hampshir and I realli am veri grate for the recent statement by former senat gordon humphrey about what

cleveland I am thrill to see all of you I have to realli thank lebron what he doe on the basketbal court you all know it make him so special it make him a champion but I am just as impress as I have told him about what he doe off the court becaus what he doe off the court is to care for everi child as though that child were hi own He ha been so commit through the lebron famili the lebron jame famili foundat he use the nation platform he earn to advoc for children everywher especi right here in ohio and it wa an extraspeci treat to have JR smith here as well I cant tell you how excit it is for me to have lebron and JR part of the team that go to take us to the white hous start on tuesday I also have to thank a lot of the elect offici that ive work with that I have such high regard for let me thank your senat sherrod brown let me thank your amaz absolut indefatig congresswoman marcia fudg let me thank your counti execut armond budish and let me thank and hope you will vote for your former governor ted strickland to be your next senat I want to thank the DJ steph floss for hi music perform and I want to thank a veri special young man yusef salaam who wa out here A young man who

pantsuit which I love but what wa most import wa how beyonc and jay Z talk about what thi elect mean for their daughter and for all of our daughter and son and that whi I am so grate to them as well as to lebron becaus thi elect realli is about the futur and it about your kid and grandkid and everi child in thi countri that we hope will have their own shot at the american dream they may not all becom champion basketbal player but everybodi should have the right to go as far as their hard work and talent will take them in america So let me ask you thi are you readi to vote are you readi to volunt for the next few day are you readi to choos our next presid well I think by now you know the choic could not be ani clearer It realli is a choic between divis or uniti between an economi that work for everyon or one that is stack for those at the top between strong steadi leadership or a loos cannon and as you think about thi choic I want you to know where I am come from becaus what I want to do as your presid is realli to build on and continu what ive done my entir life fight for kid and famili  stand up for our countri If you elect me on tuesday that what I will do everi day as your presid becaus from the start our campaign ha been focus on you you know I have now spoken in front of hundr and hundr of thousand of peopl in small group and big event and what I tri to do while Im up here speak is to realli look at the face of the peopl in front of me becaus I dont know your dream I dont know your struggl but I want so much to convey to you that I will be on your side I will fight for you fight for your famili fight for your futur I want us to do all we can to help you get ahead and stay ahead and my vision is veri differ from my oppon look we know we know enough about what he say and what he done you dont need to go through the litani of all the peopl he insult and demean but the bottom line is hi vision of america is so dark and divis it not the america that I see as I travel around our countri I want us to have a vision that is hope optimist and unifi about what we can do togeth to make sure america best year are ahead of us I love our countri and I believ in our peopl and I will never ever quit on you  no matter what now that is not to say we dont have our challeng Of cours we do were just human be but boy we have so mani asset we have so mani opportun and never forget america is great becaus america is good and if we act like that we lift each other up instead of tear each other down We can be even greater weve come through some tough econom time and lot is chang in our countri there are power forc insid and outsid of america that do threaten to pull us apart and weve arriv at a moment of reckon in thi elect our core valu as american are be test I think of all the peopl ive met across the countri in thi campaign ive heard some realli realli sad stori you know when you run for presid at least for me the moment that stand out are about somebodi grab my hand ill be in a coffe shop or mayb shake hand on a rope line and somebodi will grab my hand and they will share a realli person feel or experi with me A lot of time it about problem or troubl in their famili and I feel like they are entrust me with thi realli import piec of their live I walk away from that motiv but I also walk away confid My faith in our futur ha never been stronger and I know if we come togeth not just to win the elect that just the begin but then to work togeth there is someth for everi one of us to do in our own live our famili our neighborhood and commun I want an america where everyon ha a place where everyon includ and you know I know there a lot of frustrat and even anger in thi elect season I see it I hear it sometim you know Im the subject of it I get it but anger is not a plan anger is not go to get us new job with rise incom  that will creat a strong thrive middl class I believ that were go to grow thi economi were go to grow it from the middl out and the bottom up not the top down that is what my oppon offer and it might work for him right It might but it not go to work for the vast major of work american that whi I want us to have a big infrastructur job program that is so much work to be done good honest honor  dignifi work our road our bridg our port our airport our tunnel our water system and these are job that cant be export theyv got to be done right here in cleveland  in youngstown in dayton in akron in columbu and cincinnati and were go to bring back advanc manufactur to ohio and elsewher in our countri now some peopl when I say thi they kind of you know look at me like well that not go to happen It is go to happen and ill tell you two of my strongest alli are go to be sherrod brown and marcia fudg and I hope ted strickland when he get to washington peopl say to me all the time well how are you go to get anyth done wont there be gridlock there will onli be gridlock if peopl that are elect to repres you dont want to help you it not complic my friend If they want to keep help the wealthi the power and the wellconnect yeah then were go to have gridlock becaus I want job with rise incom I want peopl have a better shot at the futur and we are go to have more clean renewableenergi job to combat climat chang and put american to work and I want to be the best presid small busi ha ever had becaus that where most of the new job will come from and onc we get these new job and we start produc more thing in america I want peopl to buy those thing in america you know ani of you see the debat you know in that last debat I point out that donald trump ha bought chines steel to build hi last two build all the while he been run around ohio talk about what a great advoc he go to be for work peopl He didnt have to buy chines steel he didnt have to help employ chines steelwork He could have bought good american steel made by american steelwork So dont just watch what we say watch what weve done for the last 30 year and whose side weve bet on and were go to make thi economi fairer look I realli believ in hard work that how I wa rais that the kind of famili I came from So I think everybodi ha to work everybodi who can need to work but I do think we need to rais the nation minimum wage  becaus if you work full time you shouldnt still be in poverti and I also think if your work you ought to get paid fairli which is whi we need to guarante equal pay for women work and you know thi is not a woman issu thi is a famili issu becaus if youv got a mother a wife a sister or a daughter work you dont want her shortchang and we need to start recogn that a lot of the cost that famili are face now are realli burdensom I want to get child care afford right Do you know in a lot of state right now good child care cost as much or more than instat colleg tuition that crazi who could afford that and I want us to have paid famili leav so if you get sick or your spous is sick  or your parent is sick or your child is sick or you bring a newborn home now you know I dont think these are luxuri anymor I think these are all about rebuild the american middl class I believ it all about respect work provid enough job for peopl to have a good futur get incom rise make it work for everybodi and I have said I will pay for everyth Im propos without ad a penni to the nation debt right and that is in veri start contrast to my oppon becaus what ive said is I am not rais tax on the middl class anybodi make less than 250000 a year is not go to have ani tax increas while I am presid but I am go where the money is and the money is with the wealthi and corpor becaus theyv done realli well in the last 15 year and they should pay their fair share to support our countri and again peopl say to me well how are you ever go to get that through congress well ill tell you I think it pretti simpl Im go to look at all the peopl all the peopl who would be help by everyth ive just said the new job and the rest of it and Im go to compar it to the veri few peopl in everi congression district who would have their tax rais and Im go to say whose side are you on Mr or madam congresswoman are you support the five peopl in your district who will have their tax rais or are you support the 500000 peopl who will be benefit by what were go to do togeth and anoth big barrier that weve got to knock down is make colleg afford for everi singl person it outrag I meet peopl across america who couldnt afford to start colleg could not afford to stay and never graduat and still have debt they dont have a degre but theyv got debt that crazi and I see some peopl point to themselv ive got to tell you look I believ that educ is an invest that whi I want good school with good teacher in everi zip code in america that whi I want to get more technic educ back into high school becaus I think there are a lot of great job wait to be done by peopl who have the skill from high school or commun colleg  or apprenticeship program Im go to do everyth I can to lift up and honor hard work when somebodi can make someth when somebodi is a machinist or a tool and dye maker or a carpent or even a comput coder that may not at all requir a fouryear colleg educ and it about time we honor all work in america and made all work pay for everybodi but for peopl who want to go to colleg were go to make it easier I want everi public colleg and univers to be tuitionfre for famili make less than 125000 a year  and debtfre for everybodi els becaus thi should be seen as an invest and if you are struggl with student debt weve got a plan to eas that burden get the cost down get the interest rate down get it paid off much faster you see I realli believ that everi singl person should be abl to go as far as your will to work for it and not have your dream dash while your a child or a teenag or a young adult elect are about the futur so let lift up the young peopl of america and that includ let dismantl the socal schooltoprison pipelin and replac it with a cradletocolleg pipelin We have a lot of work to do ive laid out a full agenda tim kain my run mate and I weve written a book call stronger togeth and in it it tell you everyth we want to tri to do and ive got to tell you I think it import you know what we want to do It shouldnt just be an elect about word it should be about plan and polici so that you can judg and say what will help me like for exampl on colleg you can go to my websit hillaryclintoncom right now hillaryclintoncomcalcul and you can see how much money you and your famili would save under my plan and I want to be real specif I want to rebuild confid in what we can do togeth it not good for anybodi that our democraci and our countri are view so suspici without confid that is how we govern ourselv so we have to work togeth but I cant do ani of thi if you dont vote now so far 16 million peopl in ohio have vote but weve got work to do So pleas youv got to get out youv got to get to the poll youv got to take peopl to the poll nobodi should sit thi one out you can go to iwillvotecom to find out what your poll place is Or you can volunt to help us these next few day you can text

for those who are still make up your mind or think mayb it not worth vote at all let me just say the choic in thi elect could not be clearer It realli is between divis or uniti between strong and steadi leadership or a loos cannon between an economi that work for everyon not just those at the top and an economi that is set up and run for those at top now I have spent my public career fight for kid and famili and stand up for our countri and if you give me the privileg of your vote tomorrow that is what I will do everi singl day of my presid I will get up in the white hous and I will think about what I can do that day to knock down barrier to creat opportun so that you have the chanc to fulfil your own dream you see I believ america best day are still ahead of us now that doesnt mean we do have to work for it becaus we do that doesnt mean we can just expect it to happen as kind of a birthright but I realli believ that I would not have work for 18 month travel across our countri fought as hard as I have about what we need to do and how to do it togeth proudli stand up and defend the legaci of presid obama which ha  given our countri progress in the right direct if I did not believ with all my heart that we could do thi right We can do thi We dont have to accept a dark and divis vision for america tomorrow you can vote for a hope inclus bigheart america and our core valu are be test in thi elect and I know that peopl are frustrat A lot of peopl feel left out and left behind there fear even anger in our countri but ive got to say anger is not a plan my friend If were go to har our energi and tri to overcom our problem then weve got to start talk to each other again and we have to get good idea wherev they come from last night I wa in manchest new hampshir and I wa with khizr khan whose son captain khan wa kill while serv in iraq you might rememb him from the democrat convent He wa not a man to be on the stage of a polit convent but when he heard my oppon say what he said about muslim and he look at the flag that had been drape on hi son coffin he felt compel to speak out He spoke power about what america mean to him and how we have to defend our valu and our constitut As he said last night hi son serv in the unit state armi with hi unit saw someth suspici move toward it to check it out tell hi men to stay behind and when the car explod he lost hi life the bronz star and the purpl  but as Mr khan said when you listen to all of the peopl that my oppon ha insult and denigr would there be a place in donald trump america for captain khan the khan famili give me hope becaus they truli believ in the valu of of our and they have stood up hold the constitut as he did at the to say peopl around the world cherish thi constitut believ in our valu for billion of peopl we will never ever let that go and we will someon rip it away in the kind of neg divis hate campaign that we have seen in thi elect sometim when I hear my oppon speak I dont recogn  It doesnt mean we dont have problem and challeng It doesnt mean that to do more to help our countri get better econom opportun Of cours we do I believ we could  I love our countri the american peopl I know what we are capabl of throughout our histori gener of american have risen togeth to meet the test of their time they defend democraci built the greatest middl class the world ha  march for civil right for worker right  right for peopl with disabl we face the test  will we be come togeth as a nation further apart will we set goal that all of us meet will we turn on each other and pit one group of american against anoth now our name will be on the ballot tomorrow but those valu and you care about will be there too what kind of countri do we want and I particularli think about thi for young peopl as I look at so mani american who deserv the same opportun and the mani of us were given We will make sure they are avail becaus if you think about what it take to have a thrive america it come down to a coupl of key  If you believ that america thrive when the middl  then you have to vote were gonna make the biggest invest in goodpay job sinc world war II job in infrastructur small busi clean energi advanc manufactur were gonna actual deliv on that unlik my oppon who make hi product mostli oversea chines steel and aluminum made by american steel worker right here in pennsylvania in american and were especi go to invest in commun that are left out stand up for the across america economi as I do then the nation becaus nobodi who work be in poverti and were gonna do more to support work famili with afford childcar  ive got to tell you thi the biggest applaus ever becaus know it not fair but it also work you dont want do you when I talk about equal pay and all these other famili my oppon say Im play the woman card well you know what I deal me in you know if you believ all of our kid should have good school and good teacher no matter what zip code they you have to vote If that we can make colleg for everi young  and after it wa over he and I got togeth and we came up with thi plan public colleg and univers should be tuition free for everyon who make less than 125000 a year and it should be debtfre for everyon els I dont think you should go into thi massiv debt to get your educ it good for you it good for your famili it good for our countri and were go to make it afford for everyon and for the million of american alreadi struggl with student debt were go to eas that burden were go to get those interest rate down were go to give you a differ way of repay it as a percentag of your incom not tie to a six eight ten percent interest rate and your never go to have to pay more than you can afford you see I think there are a lot of posit thing to get excit about and I think the agenda weve put forth in thi campaign is one that will realli give everybodi hope you see work for children and famili ha been the caus of my life but it never been more import than it is right now So thi ha to be our mission togeth do all we can to help everi american especi everi young american and especi everi child to have the chanc to live up to your godgiven potenti becaus when it all said and done that what matter most have you help somebodi els have you reach out and tri to eas somebodi burden We do it individu My mother got through a neglect abandon childhood becaus peopl show her kind her own parent didnt want her her grandpar didnt want her but that first grade teacher who saw she had noth to eat brought extra food everi singl day to make sure my mother had someth to eat and when she wa 14 and had to go out and find a job to support herself and got a job as a maid and a babysitt in somebodi home she wa just reliev that she had a place to live and that she could support herself but the mother of that home understood my mom want to go to high school So she said dorothi if you get up earli and you get your chore done you can go to high school youll have to come right back becaus well need you but you can do it now look that sound harsh to our ear tell a 14yearold OK you can go to high school but youv got to come right back and you have to work on both side of it but to my mother it wa a bless So when I think about what so mani peopl have gone through to give us the opportun that we have had  and Im speak for myself My mother gave me the resili the grit

I know that for mani peopl youv gone back and forth youv thought about what to do and I realli respect that but let me say thi let me say thi thi elect is basic between divis and uniti in our countri it between strong and steadi leadership or a loos cannon who could put everyth at risk It is between an economi that work for everyon or one that is even more stack for those at the top and I want each and everi one of you to be think through about all the issu that you care about becaus although my name and my oppon name will be on the ballot those issu and those valu are on the ballot as well and as you think about what you care about and what you want your futur to look like you have to recogn thi is a consequenti elect I have been privileg to know a lot of our presid over the past decad and peopl who ran for presid I wa privileg to know as a colleg student gerald ford In fact I had an internship with the hous republican confer committe which he head after my junior year in colleg So when I say ive gotten to know a lot of our presid and peopl whove run for presid it goe back a way and here what I want you to understand I didnt agre with everyth they did or said even the democrat We had differ and polit and polici and sometim on principl but I never doubt I never doubt that they were fit to serv as our presid and commanderinchief that whi thi elect is so differ and it whi so mani republican have spoken out to endors me and support me and who have taken veri courag stand against the nomine of their own parti becaus they believ that we must put countri ahead of parti when it come to thi elect I wa at kent state in ohio last week and I wa introduc by a gentleman by the name of bruce blair and Mr blair had serv in the air forc he wa a young offic assign to be what wa call a launch offic that meant he serv hi time everi day sit in a bunker where the control for launch nuclear weapon were hous and hi job  imagin the respons A young air forc offic in hi twenti wait to hear whether or not an order is given for him to launch nuclear weapon and bruce blair explain that there is no appeal from a presid order to do that the joint chief of our militari forc cant say No dont do it there no veto from congress or anyon els and the time between the order be given and the actual launch is four minut So after watch thi elect Mr blair began contact other who had serv in thi incred respons posit to share hi concern about what he wa hear and see and sever dozen of them  Id never met them befor  sever dozen of them wrote a letter explain whi they could never support donald trump to be our commanderinchief the awesom respons that is hous in one person is someth I want you to think about between now and the time you vote becaus I will pledg to you that I will exercis the greatest care and respons in all of the power invest in the offic of the presid I also want to pose to you a contrast in vision did ani of you see the debat first of all I did stand for four and a half hour with donald trump on the stage prove conclus I have the stamina to be presid but I have to say in addit to that there were so mani thing that he said that of cours I sometim wa surpris by but the theme that ran through much of hi rhetor wa the present of a dark and divis vision for america now I have to tell you I know weve got problem ive spent 18 month travel around our countri talk to  by now  hundr and hundr of thousand of peopl hear what on peopl mind weve got challeng but america alway had challeng and sinc when do we becom pessimist and not abl to think about what we can do to overcom those challeng and solv those problem togeth I often didnt recogn the countri that donald trump wa describ becaus from my perspect look back at our histori we have a tremend opportun ahead of us and you can vote for a hope inclus bigheart america that will set the stage for an even better futur and I want to say especi to the student who are here  I realli believ that america best day are still ahead of us if we reach for them togeth make no mistak our core valu are be test in thi elect but my faith in our futur ha never been stronger last night in manchest new hampshir I wa introduc by Mr khizr khan some of you know or rememb that hi son captain khan serv in the unit state armi wa kill serv in iraq and like at the democrat convent thi summer he spoke power about what america mean to him and how we have to defend our valu and our constitut that are the envi of the rest of the world peopl look at us with yearn they see that we are a beacon of freedom hope and opportun for peopl right here at home when I heard Mr khan speak at the convent and I heard him again last night I wa so touch becaus what he said exhibit a love of our countri He said that when he start hear donald trump speak and all of the thing he said about so mani peopl not onli muslim but africanamerican and latino and pow and women and so mani peopl  when he heard it he couldnt help but think as he walk around hi hous  he ha a room where hi son medal  he got the bronz star he got the purpl heart  the flag that wa drape on hi coffin  is respect present in the box that he wa given it in and he thought to himself would there be ani room for my son in donald trump america think about that for a minut becaus everi singl one of us ha someth to contribut To thi great countri We are alreadi great but we can be greater and we will be greater  I love our countri and I believ in the american peopl and I know there is noth we cant do when we make up our mind throughout our histori gener of american have risen togeth to meet the test of their time they defend democraci they built the greatest middl class the world ha ever known they march for civil right and vote right for worker right and union right for lgbt right right for peopl with disabl   and now weve got to come togeth and we have to prove we can meet the challeng of our time weve got to get the economi work for everybodi not just those at the top If you believ as I do that america thrive when the middl class thrive then you have to vote tomorrow We are go to make the biggest invest in good pay job sinc world war II job in infrastructur our road our bridg our tunnel our port our airport our water system these are job we need do in american and these are job that cannot be export theyv got to be done right here in michigan and across our countri and we are go to invest in new job in advanc manufactur I am not one of these folk who think We just cant make it in america anymor and ill tell you whi becaus if we have a plan and we actual commit to fulfil that plan we can lead the world in precis machin in 3D print were not compet for lowwag job were compet with germani for high manufactur high skill job and we are go to have clean renew energi job as a way to fight climat chang As you heard my oppon chose to make mani of hi product oversea and as I point out in the last debat he buy cheap chines steel and aluminum instead of good american steel made by american steel worker he gone all over thi countri and he gone all over michigan talk about how he gonna realli get more job and he go to bring back what use to be there well ill tell you what look at hi record dont just listen to hi rhetor becaus I have a differ idea were go to invest in america again and for everybodi who is frustrat and anxiou and mayb even angri becaus they feel left out left behind that america not work the way it should  I understand that I understand that I repres upstat new york for eight year and I saw first hand a lot of the loss of job and factori pick up and move out but I also realiz that anger is not a plan youv got to come togeth and figur out what is it were gonna do to bring new job back and creat more opportun for peopl and ill just tell you that I believ that weve got to defend the american worker right to organ and bargain for better wage and benefit were gonna get incom rise here in western michigan and across thi state and were also gonna do more to help small busi My dad wa a small businessman He work realli hard He ran a print plant that print fabric for draperi and I would from time to time help him out you take a silkscreen you put it down on the long tabl you pour the paint in you do the squeege you pick it up  it wasnt autom we were the automat  and youd go all the way down to one tabl youd go to the other tabl So I know how hard peopl in small busi work and I also know someth els donald trump made a lot of money off the back of small busi peopl and contractor by stif them and refus to pay hi bill and I have said I am sure glad my dad never got a contract from donald trump becaus we could not have afford that but it not just enough to grow the economi We have to make it fairer and if you believ we need a fairer economi then you have to vote I think the best antidot for whatev ail a person is a good job I believ in hard work that how I wa rais but I also believ that if you work hard and you work full time you shouldnt still be in poverti at the end of the year and Im gonna rais the nation minimum wage and one of the thing ive heard all over america especi from young famili realli from all famili but particularli young famili is how hard it is to do so mani of the thing that are expect  like where do you find afford qualiti childcar In lot of state it more expens than colleg tuition were gonna get the cost of childcar down were go to have a paid famili leav program so that when you have a sick rel or your sick you wont lose your job I saw the folk over there hold up the tim kain sign and I realli appreci that thank you thank you I got to tell you  tim and I were in pittsburgh last month with a big crowd and we couldnt get everybodi in like today so tim went out to say hello to peopl and he saw a woman hold a babi probabl about three year old and he stop to talk to her and she said I came here becaus I want to tell you and to tell hillari clinton what happen to me she said that I had my babi it wa a hard labor and deliveri and I need some time off and I call by boss and said the doctor want me to take some time off and so I wont be in for  I think she said two week  and they said OK your fire that is legal in america still and what that doe is to say that  wait a minut do we realli valu children Do we realli valu famili and weve got to have a system that is fair to employ and fair to employe becaus you got to be abl to balanc work and famili in today america and then final I think it is way past time to guarante equal pay for women work and you know I gotta say  thi alway get a huge round of applaus as you can tell  but thi is not just a woman issu it a famili issu If you have a wife a mother a sister a daughter who in the work forc you want her to be paid what she deserv to be paid to help you and your famili just about everyth ive said so far my oppon disagre with and whenev I talk about afford childcar and paid famili leav and equal pay  he say Im play the woman card and you know what I say if that the case then deal me in and here what els I want you to know it fair to ask how are you go to pay for that that not onli fair that necessari to ask becaus I want to be a good steward of your tax dollar just as I expect your a good steward of your famili budget I have propos a veri simpl formula I will not rais tax on anyon make less than 250000 a year and for small busi were gonna cut your tax becaus I know a lot of small busi need that kind of tax relief So instead were go where the money is to the millionair and the billionair and the big corpor and that is in stark contrast to what donald trump ha propos hi whole econom plan is cut trillion of dollar in tax from millionair and billionair and corpor that is trickledown econom on steroid I profoundli disagre I think the way you build an economi is from the middl out and the bottom up not from the top down when you think about it donald hasnt paid anyth for 20 year he paid zero to support our militari our vet pell grant for student here at grand valley our highway  and I am still ponder I am just ponder how anybodi can lose a billion dollar in one year especi when your run casino I do not understand that but that will be one of the mysteri in thi campaign becaus he not go to releas hi tax return now and the time you start vote and that sort of suggest there must be someth realli terribl in those tax return becaus everybodi els for more than 40 year ha releas them So well still wonder but what we know is hi econom approach will cost us job not creat job and we cant afford that We need to keep build We have recov from the worst financi crash sinc the great depress but were not where we need to be yet the last thing we need is a fail econom polici come back in and push us back down and depriv peopl of the job that we want to creat and if you believ all of our kid should have good school and good teacher no matter what zip code they live in then you have to vote and if you believ colleg should be afford you have to vote ive got to say I am proud of the campaign that berni sander and I ran It wa a campaign about idea and issu not insult and when it wa over we actual got togeth what a novel idea We want to figur out how we can work togeth to actual produc on some of the goal that we both share SO berni and I work on thi plan togeth public colleg and univers should be tuitionfre for everyon who make less than a 125000 a year and they should be debtfre for everyon els becaus nobodi should go into debt and if you have gone into debt if your among the million of american who are struggl  as I see some hand point in the air  pay back your student debt we are go to help you pay it down and pay it off It make no sens at all We have interest rate that are realli low right now buy a car for what 1 or 2 percent you can buy a hous for 34 percent there are so mani peopl who are pay 8 10 12 higher  8 10 12 percent interest  how much twelv point seven fourteen point one I got to tell you friend that is outrag the feder govern should not be make money off of send kid to colleg I cant wait to roll up my sleev with debbi and berni and were gonna get to work right after thi elect if I am fortun enough to win look work for children and famili ha been the caus of my life but it never been more import than it is right now and that ha to be our mission togeth do all we can to help everi american and especi everi young american and everi child in america to have the chanc to live up to their godgiven potenti I will wake up everi singl day in the white hous tri to figur out what I can do to make that a realiti for you So after tomorrow the work will begin and one of the highest prioriti that I feel an oblig to address is how we bring our countri togeth A lot of peopl say weve got to heal our countri or as the bibl say repair the breach becaus we have so much divis right now weve got to start listen to each other respect each other I know it is unusu I admit for somebodi run for presid especi the day befor an elect but ive been say thi for month To say that we need more of two thing right now We need more love and kind in america I dont know about you I dont know about you but I bet everyon of us ha receiv a kind and mayb I hope weve all extend one I am stand here today becaus my mother who wa abandon by her parent reject by her grandpar went to work at the age of 14 as a maid and a babysitt wa extend kind not by those who should have love her but by other the first grade teacher who saw she had noth to eat at lunch who began bring extra food the woman whose hous she went to work in who knew that my mother want to go to high school she would have been a freshman in high school when she had to leav her grandpar home and she got thi job and that woman said I know you want to go to high school If you get up earli and you get your chore done you can go to high school but youll have to come back becaus well need you in the late afternoon now that may sound harsh to say to a 14year old but to my mother it wa a gift I tell you thi becaus we all have to start think about how we want to be treat and what that mean about how we treat other and  there a version of the golden rule in everi major religion and it is a remind that everi one of us get knock down the question as my mother would say is are you gonna get back up and for peopl in our countri who feel like theyv been knock down and nobodi care nobodi pay attent here what I want you to know If you give me the honor of be your presid Im gonna do everyth I can to get thi countri and everybodi in it back up on our feet move forward togeth becaus I want to be a presid for all american democrat republican independ not just the peopl who support me everybodi in thi countri becaus I believ with all my heart each of us ha a role to play in build a better futur So let take that first step

when other go low we go high Im pretti sure as they said tonight that the best way to thank them is to do someth realli import tomorrow to vote everi singl one of you and everi person you know becaus as the presid just point out there is a clear choic in thi elect a choic between divis or uniti between an economi that work for everyon or onli those at the top between strong steadi leadership or a loos cannon who could put everyth at risk So make no mistak our core valu are be test in thi elect We know enough about my oppon we know who he is the real question for us is what kind of countri we

Zipf's law states that given some corpus of natural language utterances, the frequency of any word is inversely proportional to its rank in the frequency table. Thus the most frequent word will occur approximately twice as often as the second most frequent word, three times as often as the third most frequent word, etc.: the rank-frequency distribution is an inverse relation.\"\n",
